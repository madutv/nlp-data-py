World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million.. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways.
A myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin,  which serves to greatly increase the speed of signal propagation.. (There are also unmyelinated axons).
In mammals it is usually referred to as the superior colliculus, and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements.. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions.
It is now possible with relative ease to "knock out" or mutate a wide variety of genes, and then examine the effects on brain function.. More sophisticated approaches are also being used: for example, using Cre-Lox recombination it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain, at specific times.


=== History ===

The oldest brain to have been discovered was in Armenia in the Areni-1 cave complex.
Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain.. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%.
Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical, and until the middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes.. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses.
These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons.. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell.
The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 10–20 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion.
Among other things, it contains nuclei that control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep, respiration, swallowing, bladder function, equilibrium, eye movement, facial expressions, and posture.
The hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the forebrain, whose complexity and importance belies its size.. It is composed of numerous small nuclei, each with distinct connections and neurochemistry.
Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.
Semantic memory is the ability to learn facts and relationships.. This sort of memory is probably stored largely in the cerebral cortex, mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information.
Instrumental learning is the ability for rewards and punishments to modify behavior.
The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain.. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.One of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain: the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the retina and optic tectum of frogs, and came to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as "bug perceivers".
(This principle is widely used in engineering, for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat.)
In vertebrates, the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function.. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions.
The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively.. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.


=== Learning and memory ===
Almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience—even the most primitive types of worms.
Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage.. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function.
In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.


== Physiology ==
The functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells, and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells.. The electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes, most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses.


=== Neurotransmitters and receptors ===
Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them—neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell, and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules.
With few exceptions, each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle.
These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal.. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.


=== Perception ===

The human brain is provided with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more.
Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy.. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error.
This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements.. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas.
Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons.. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.
Physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body.
There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life.. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories.
These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies.. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus.
It is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the basal ganglia.
Motor learning is the ability to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition.. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.


== Research ==

The field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system.
The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones.. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment.
Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure.. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.

In the first half of the 20th century, advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells, culminating in work by Alan Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley, and others on the biophysics of the action potential, and the work of Bernard Katz and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse.
The SCN contains the body's central biological clock.. Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, circadian rhythms: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of "clock genes".
The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors.. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path.
Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.Neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the brain in distinct ways:

Working memory is the ability of the brain to maintain a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in.
The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats.. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons.
Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.Once a neuron is in place, it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it.. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way.
The computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists.Computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.
Recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain  and a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity.. The most common subjects are mice, because of the availability of technical tools.
Nevertheless, there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species.. Some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species; others distinguish "advanced" brains from more primitive ones, or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates.The simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed.
Myelin is white, making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light-colored white matter, in contrast to the darker-colored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies.


=== Evolution ===


==== Generic bilaterian nervous system ====

Except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous system) and cnidarians (which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net), all living multicellular animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape (that is, left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other).. All bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the Cambrian period, 485-540 million years ago, and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body.
The basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out.. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted.
The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses.. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.The synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though.
Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.
In addition to all of the above, the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the autonomic nervous system, which works by secreting hormones and by modulating the "smooth" muscles of the gut.


=== Arousal ===

Many animals alternate between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle.. Arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas.A key component of the arousal system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross.
This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory.. Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain.
Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain.. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback: any time a parameter diverges from its set-point, sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value.
It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes.. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain.
The unknown author of On the Sacred Disease, a medical treatise in the Hippocratic Corpus, came down unequivocally in favor of the brain, writing:

Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations.. ...
Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.There are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have properties that make them convenient for experimental work:

Fruit flies (Drosophila), because of the large array of techniques available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development.. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics have been shown to be relevant to humans.
Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important.. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience.
In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci.. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.
The hippocampus, strictly speaking, is found only in mammals.
There it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take.. The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment.
Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons.. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress.
With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life.. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.There has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy.
Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.Although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains, some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry, especially in the forebrain area.. The brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way, but in teleost fishes (the great majority of existing fish species), the forebrain has become "everted", like a sock turned inside out.
The primary function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory signals to all parts of the brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions.. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia.
The olfactory bulb is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium.
Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices.. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways.
A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them.. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.Most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons, which are often bundled together in what are called nerve fiber tracts.
It has not been definitively established whether the existence of these brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain, or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.


==== Invertebrates ====

This category includes tardigrades, arthropods, molluscs, and numerous types of worms.. The diversity of invertebrate body plans is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures.Two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs).
These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second.. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.Axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses.
Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex.. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.Sleep involves great changes in brain activity.
Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances.. Finally, on the basis of the results, it generates motor response patterns.
One of the advantages of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm.. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body.
Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis.. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters.
In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task.. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain.
Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system.. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders.
The brain is small and simple in some species, such as nematode worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is the most complex organ in the body.. Some types of worms, such as leeches, also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord, known as a "tail brain".There are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including echinoderms and tunicates.
The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.The SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles.. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain.
The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.

Synapses are the key functional elements of the brain.. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs.
Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.


=== Electrical activity ===

As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active.. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG).
It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex.. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control.
In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively).. At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size.
At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing.. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs.
The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists on both sides of the argument.
In the second half of the 20th century, developments in chemistry, electron microscopy, genetics, computer science, functional brain imaging, and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function.. In the United States, the 1990s were officially designated as the "Decade of the Brain" to commemorate advances made in brain research, and to promote funding for such research.In the 21st century, these trends have continued, and several new approaches have come into prominence, including multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.


== Other uses ==


=== As food ===

Animal brains are used as food in numerous cuisines.


=== In rituals ===
Some archaeological evidence suggests that the mourning rituals of European Neanderthals also involved the consumption of the brain.The Fore people of Papua New Guinea are known to eat human brains.
Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes.
Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations.. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.


=== Cellular structure ===

The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells.
They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body.. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer.
Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases.. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems.
The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).Neuroanatomists usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata.. Each of these areas has a complex internal structure.
Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.
The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.. Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.
This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.
In funerary rituals, those close to the dead would eat the brain of the deceased to create a sense of immortality.. A prion disease called kuru has been traced to this.


=== For tanning ===
The brain can be useful to hunters: most animals have enough brain matter for use in the tanning of their own hides.

The Brain, BBC Radio 4 discussion with Vivian Nutton, Jonathan Sawday & Marina Wallace (In Our Time, May 8, 2008)
A few years later David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of view—a discovery for which they won a Nobel Prize.. Follow-up studies in higher-order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity, color, movement, and aspects of shape, with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses.
Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain.. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers.
At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe.. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract.
EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep.. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state.
Until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different.. There are two types of sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode.
In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.For vertebrates, the early stages of neural development are similar across all species.. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system.
Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior.. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color.
Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations.. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections.
The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism.. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises.
Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context.. The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.


== Anatomy ==

The shape and size of the brain varies greatly between species, and identifying common features is often difficult.
Aristotle favored the heart, and thought that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood.. Democritus, the inventor of the atomic theory of matter, argued for a three-part soul, with intellect in the head, emotion in the heart, and lust near the liver.
Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space.. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei.
As a rule, brain size increases with body size, but not in a simple linear proportion.. In general, smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size.
The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum.. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.
The optic tectum allows actions to be directed toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input.
This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality.. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.


=== Motor control ===
Motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles.
For mammals, the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 0.75.. This formula describes the central tendency, but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior.
In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium.. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex.
It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.


== Development ==

The brain develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages.. It changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections.
The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.Similar things happen in other brain areas: an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs.. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.In humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain.
Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret.. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.Computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches: first, the use of computers to study the brain; second, the study of how brains perform computation.
All of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded.Brains are most simply compared in terms of their size.. The relationship between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species.
At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus).. At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata).
Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.Most organisms studied to date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers.. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain.
The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision.
It takes into account the nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship.. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range.
Sharks appeared about 450 Mya, amphibians about 400 Mya, reptiles about 350 Mya, and mammals about 200 Mya.. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence.
Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.
Most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and the parts of the cortex involved in vision.. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections.
Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development.. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain.
The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances.
Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.


=== Homeostasis ===

For any animal, survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others.. The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur, as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (Greek for "standing still").
The hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles, eating and drinking, and the release of some hormones.
The thalamus is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions: some are involved in relaying information to and from the cerebral hemispheres, while others are involved in motivation.. The subthalamic area (zona incerta) seems to contain action-generating systems for several types of "consummatory" behaviors such as eating, drinking, defecation, and copulation.
The cerebellum modulates the outputs of other brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, to make them certain and precise.
The brain, estimated to be over 5,000 years old, was found in the skull of a 12 to 14-year-old girl.. Although the brains were shriveled, they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave.Early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart.
Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves.. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, usually translated as "animal spirits".
This sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.
Episodic memory is the ability to remember the details of specific events.. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime.
For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts.. Predators tend to have larger brains than their prey, relative to body size.

All vertebrate brains share a common underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development.
The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.


=== Motivation ===

The individual animals need to express survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate.. The motivational system in the brain monitors the current state of satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise.
Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.The elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas.. The superior colliculus, which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex.
A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells.. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released.
No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though.. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.Furthermore, even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations.
In birds, there are also major changes in forebrain structure.. These distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species.

Here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain components, along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood:

The medulla, along with the spinal cord, contains many small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and digestive processes.
The pons lies in the brainstem directly above the medulla.
He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical res cogitans, but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of animals, could be explained mechanistically.The first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani (1737 – 1798), who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract.. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation.
Serotonin, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei.. Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus.
Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain.. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain.
Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory.. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas.
The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.


===== Primates =====

The brains of humans and other primates contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size.. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species.
Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells.. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon.
At a schematic level, that basic worm-shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians, including vertebrates.. The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain.
Other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates, some related to memory, some to abstract types of cognition such as space.Theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers.. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons.
The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.
The pallium is a layer of gray matter that lies on the surface of the forebrain and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ.. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex.Bioinformatics and studies in genomics, and functional genomics, generated the need for DNA annotation, a transcriptome technology, identifying genes, and their and location and function.. GeneCards is a major database.
As of 2017, just under 20,000 protein-coding genes are seen to be expressed in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific.
Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and clinical depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions.. The brain can also be the site of tumours, both benign and malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body.
The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy, while the study of its function is neuroscience.
The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus.. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids.
Sensation collected by a sensory receptor on the skin is changed to a nerve signal, that is passed up a series of neurons through tracts in the spinal cord.. The dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway contains information about fine touch, vibration and position of joints.
Another technique is functional near-infrared spectroscopy.. These methods rely on the haemodynamic response that shows changes in brain activity in relation to changes in blood flow, useful in mapping functions to brain areas.
Damage can be caused by trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke.. The brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.
Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve.. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve.
By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions.. The capacity of the brain to re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.Harvey Cushing (1869–1939) is recognised as the first proficient brain surgeon in the world.
Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right.. The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.
The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord.
Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognised as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O.. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field.
The circle of Willis was named after his investigations into the blood supply of the brain, and he was the first to use the word "neurology." Willis removed the brain from the body when examining it, and rejected the commonly held view that the cortex only consisted of blood vessels and the view of the last two millennia that the cortex was only incidentally important.In the late 19th century, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Hermann von Helmholtz, following the work of their teacher Johannes Peter Müller showed the electrical inpulses which pass along nerves; but unlike Müller's views, that such impulses were able to be observed.. Richard Caton in 1875 demonstrated electrical impulses in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys.
Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.


=== Regulation ===
Autonomic functions of the brain include the regulation, or rhythmic control of the heart rate and rate of breathing, and maintaining homeostasis.
Blood pressure and heart rate are influenced by the vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest.. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve.
Difficulties with movement, speech, or sight usually relate to the cerebrum, whereas imbalance, double vision, vertigo and symptoms affecting more than one side of the body usually relate to the brainstem or cerebellum.Most strokes result from loss of blood supply, typically because of an embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries.. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain.
Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles.. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso and limbs.

Gray's Anatomy : the anatomical basis of clinical practice (40th ed.).. London: Churchill Livingstone.
These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making.. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behaviour, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality.
He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed.. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.


=== Renaissance ===
In 1316, Mondino de Luzzi's Anathomia began the modern study of brain anatomy.Niccolò Massa discovered in 1536 that the ventricles were filled with fluid.
Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies.. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells.Although the human brain represents only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization.
There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep.. Whilst awake the brain consumes a fifth of the body's total energy needs.
The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.Paul Broca associated regions of the brain with specific functions, in particular language in Broca's area, following work on brain-damaged patients.. John Hughlings Jackson described the function of the motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body.
A rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as lissencephaly is characterised by the lack of, or inadequacy of, cortical folding.. Normal development of the brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies, teratogens, infectious diseases, and by the use of recreational drugs and alcohol.


=== Stroke ===

A stroke is a decrease in blood supply to an area of the brain causing cell death and brain injury.
These two circulations join together in the circle of Willis, a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular cistern between the midbrain and pons.The internal carotid arteries are branches of the common carotid arteries.. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space.
The cerebellum's anterior and posterior lobes appear to play a role in the coordination and smoothing of complex motor movements, and the flocculonodular lobe in the maintenance of balance although debate exists as to its cognitive, behavioural and motor functions.


==== Brainstem ====

The brainstem lies beneath the cerebrum and consists of the midbrain, pons and medulla.. It lies in the back part of the skull, resting on the part of the base known as the clivus, and ends at the foramen magnum, a large opening in the occipital bone.
The adult human brain is estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons, with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells.. Out of these neurons, 16 billion (19%) are located in the cerebral cortex, and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum.Types of glial cell are astrocytes (including Bergmann glia), oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells (including tanycytes), radial glial cells and microglia.
These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope.. The cortex is divided into two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex.
Human embryology (3rd ed.).. Philadelphia, Pa.: Churchill Livingstone.
These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.The function of sleep is not fully understood; however, there is evidence that sleep enhances the clearance of metabolic waste products, some of which are potentially neurotoxic, from the brain and may also permit repair.. Evidence suggests that the increased clearance of metabolic waste during sleep occurs via increased functioning of the glymphatic system.
Different biological approaches using imaging have given more insight for example into the disorders of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.. A key source of information about the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them.Advances in neuroimaging have enabled objective insights into mental disorders, leading to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and better monitoring.


=== Gene and protein expression ===

Bioinformatics is a field of study that includes the creation and advancement of databases, and computational and statistical techniques, that can be used in studies of the human brain, particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression.
Behind the brainstem is the cerebellum (Latin: little brain).The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord are covered by three membranes called meninges.. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater.
However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.


=== In popular culture ===

Research has disproved some common misconceptions about the brain.. These include both ancient and modern myths.
Colledge, Brian R.. Walker, Stuart H.
Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses.. Neurons connect to form neural pathways, neural circuits, and elaborate network systems.
The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells.. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells.
There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function.. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body.
Waltham, MA: Elsevier.. ISBN 978-0-12-385-870-2.
Standring, Susan (editor-in-chief) ; Borley, Neil R.
The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise.. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.
These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine.. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter.
The boundaries between the specialties of neuroscience, neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience.
Neuroscience research has expanded considerably in recent decades.. The "Decade of the Brain", an initiative of the United States Government in the 1990s, is considered to have marked much of this increase in research, and was followed in 2013 by the BRAIN Initiative.
He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness.. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum.
The Human Connectome Project was a five-year study launched in 2009 to analyse the anatomical and functional connections of parts of the brain, and has provided much data.


=== Methods ===
Information about the structure and function of the human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans.. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage.
The hypothalamus also plays a role in thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever.. The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys – when blood pressure falls, the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink.
This flexed part becomes the forebrain (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon).. These three areas are formed as swellings known as the primitive vesicles.
Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours.. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on the duration of the symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking).
They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla.. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches.
A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer.. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour.
The sigmoid drains into the large internal jugular veins.


==== The blood–brain barrier ====
The larger arteries throughout the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries.. These smallest of blood vessels in the brain, are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood–brain barrier.
The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern humans) was marked by a steady increase in brain size.. As brain size increased, this altered the size and shape of the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520 cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis.
The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system.. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum.
Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier.. ISBN 978-0-7020-3085-7.CS1 maint: Uses editors parameter (link) 
Hall, John (2011).
The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches.. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries.
There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition.. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language.
The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition.. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus.
Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature.. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised.
However, the presence of a glymphatic or paravascular system has been proposed.. Newer studies (2015) from two laboratories have shown the presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels running alongside the blood vessels, and these have been shown with lymph valves, to be more extensive at the base of the brain where they exit with the cranial nerves.


=== Blood supply ===

The internal carotid arteries supply oxygenated blood to the front of the brain and the vertebral arteries supply blood to the back of the brain.
The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through the release of peptides such as oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as dopamine into the median eminence.. Through the autonomic projections, the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, sweating, and other homeostatic mechanisms.
(2006).. Human physiology : the basis of medicine (3rd ed.).
The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision.. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions.
Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings.. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.Some brain disorders such as Tay–Sachs disease are congenital, and linked to genetic and chromosomal mutations.
The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter.. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex.
It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns.. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid.
It is 2 to 4 millimetres (0.079 to 0.157 in) thick, and deeply folded to give a convoluted appearance.. Beneath the cortex is the white matter of the brain.
The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail.. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube.
This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted.. In some countries there is also a defined syndrome of brainstem death.
The relationship between the brain and the mind is a significant challenge both philosophically and scientifically.. This is because of the difficulty in explaining how mental activities, such as thoughts and emotions, can be implemented by physical structures such as neurons and synapses, or by any other type of physical mechanism.
Tractography uses MRI and image analysis to create 3D images of the nerve tracts of the brain.. Connectograms give a graphical representation of the neural connections of the brain.Differences in brain structure can be measured in some disorders, notably schizophrenia and dementia.
These patients, when briefly shown a picture on the right side of the point of visual fixation, are able to describe it verbally, but when the picture is shown on the left, are unable to describe it, but may be able to give an indication with the left hand of the nature of the object shown.


=== Emotion ===

Emotions are generally defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies.. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding no evidence for specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes.
This can lead to a wide range of symptoms, including the "FAST" symptoms of facial droop, arm weakness, and speech difficulties (including with speaking and finding words or forming sentences).. Symptoms relate to the function of the affected area of the brain and can point to the likely site and cause of the stroke.
Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid.. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.
The living brain is very soft, having a gel-like consistency similar to soft tofu.
The expanding caudal end of the hemisphere has to curve over in a forward direction to fit into the restricted space.. This covers the fossa and turns it into a much deeper ridge known as the lateral sulcus and this marks out the temporal lobe.
Neurological differences between the sexes have not been shown to correlate in any simple way with IQ or other measures of cognitive performance.The cerebrum, consisting of the cerebral hemispheres, forms the largest part of the brain and is situated above the other brain structures.. The outer region of the hemispheres, the cerebral cortex, is grey matter, consisting of cortical layers of neurons.
They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging.. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain.
These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.Other related studies have also shown evidence of synaptic alterations and their loss, in the ageing brain.. Changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various pathways and this has been shown to be evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss.
Neurodegenerative diseases can affect different parts of the brain, and can affect movement, memory, and cognition.The brain, although protected by the blood–brain barrier, can be affected by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi.. Infection may be of the meninges (meningitis), the brain matter (encephalitis), or within the brain matter (such as a cerebral abscess).
Supposing this, one should, when visiting within it, find only parts pushing one another, and never anything by which to explain a perception.
— Leibniz, Monadology
Doubt about the possibility of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain.. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction.
By the sixth month other sulci have formed that demarcate the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes.. A gene present in the human genome (ArhGAP11B) may play a major role in gyrification and encephalisation.


== Function ==


=== Motor control ===
The motor system of the brain is responsible for the generation and control of movement.
The blood–brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus.. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.


== Development ==

At the beginning of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate.
The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals.. Brain metabolism normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose.
Neurons travel up the spinal cord and connect with second-order neurons in the reticular formation of the brainstem for pain and temperature, and also at the ventrobasal complex of the medulla for gross touch.Vision is generated by light that hits the retina of the eye.. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that is sent to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe.
Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue in and around the brain.. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue.

There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways.. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain.
Seizures have a large number of causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found.. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress.
The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness.. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI.
The telencephalon gives rise to the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures.. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus.
This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.Taste is generated from receptors on the tongue and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem.. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve.
Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron.. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.Invasive measures include electrocorticography, which uses electrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain.
Each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes, although Terminologia Anatomica (1998) and Terminologia Neuroanatomica (2017) also include a limbic lobe and treat the insular cortex as a lobe.The brainstem, resembling a stalk, attaches to and leaves the cerebrum at the start of the midbrain area.. The brainstem includes the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata.
Types of neuron include interneurons, pyramidal cells including Betz cells, motor neurons (upper and lower motor neurons), and cerebellar Purkinje cells.. Betz cells are the largest cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system.
In 1937, Walter Dandy began the practice of vascular neurosurgery by performing the first surgical clipping of an intracranial aneurysm.


== Comparative anatomy ==

The human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains.. Many of its features are common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex and a set of associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala.
Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe.. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas.
The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.
Gross movement – such as locomotion and the movement of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts.. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area.
The third ventricle lies in the midline and is connected to the lateral ventricles.. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle.

Pocock, G.; Richards, C.
Bruising may cause widespread damage to the nerve tracts that can lead to a condition of diffuse axonal injury.. A fractured skull, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion are also possible immediate developments.
Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, the ability to think about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action.. Higher order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions, and include planning and fluid intelligence (i.e., reasoning and problem solving).The prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in mediating executive functions.
By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end.. These swellings represent the beginnings of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.
Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation.. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.When brain death is suspected, reversible differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression need to be excluded.
In all neurons, ELAVL3 is expressed, and in pyramidal neurons, NRGN and REEP2 are also expressed.. GAD1 – essential for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA – is expressed in interneurons.
Neurons travel up the back part of the spinal cord to the back part of the medulla, where they connect with "second order" neurons that immediately swap sides.. These neurons then travel upwards into the ventrobasal complex in the thalamus where they connect with "third order" neurons, and travel up to the sensory cortex.The spinothalamic tract carries information about pain, temperature, and gross touch.
Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex, as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.


== Physiology ==


=== Neurotransmission ===

Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets.. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites.
This was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the then revolutionary hypothesis that the neuron is the functional unit of the brain.. He used microscopy to uncover many cell types, and proposed functions for the cells he saw.
Further investigation is needed in younger patients.. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale.
Some of these processes end as perivascular end-feet on capillary walls.. The glia limitans of the cortex is made up of astrocyte foot processes that serve in part to contain the cells of the brain.Mast cells are white blood cells that interact in the neuroimmune system in the brain.
The underlying white matter does not grow at the same rate and the hemispheres are crowded into the small cranial vault.. The first cleft to appear in the fourth month is the lateral cerebral fossa.
Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.The blood in the deep part of the brain drains, through a venous plexus into the cavernous sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back.. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior sagittal sinus, which rests in the midline on top of the brain.
There are many small variations in the secondary and tertiary folds.
Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them.. Each lobe is associated with one or two specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them.The cortex is mapped by divisions into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas.
Rare prion diseases including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant, and kuru may also affect the brain.Brain tumours can be either benign or cancerous.. Most malignant tumours arise from another part of the body, most commonly from the lung, breast and skin.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy can develop following multiple head injuries.Neurodegenerative diseases result in progressive damage to different parts of the brain's function, and worsen with age.. Common examples include dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, alcoholic dementia or vascular dementia; Parkinson's disease; and other rarer infectious, genetic, or metabolic causes such as Huntington's disease, motor neuron diseases, HIV dementia, syphilis-related dementia and Wilson's disease.
The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration.. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres.
Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.The left and right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they function asymmetrically.. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand.
The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.Other animals, including whales and elephants have larger brains than humans.. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, the human brain is almost twice as large as that of a bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee.
This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla.. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.The brain controls the rate of breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons.
An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins.. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell.
For this, Golgi and Cajal are considered the founders of twentieth century neuroscience, both sharing the Nobel prize in 1906 for their studies and discoveries in this field.Charles Sherrington published his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining the function of reflexes, evolutionary development of the nervous system, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system.. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938.
This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres.. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres.
The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, directly in front of the somatosensory area.. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus.
Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds.. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest.
In 1664 in Cerebri Anatome (Latin: Anatomy of the brain), followed by Cerebral Pathology in 1667.. In these he described the structure of the cerebellum, the ventricles, the cerebral hemispheres, the brainstem, and the cranial nerves, studied its blood supply; and proposed functions associated with different areas of the brain.
This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.


=== Imaging ===

Functional neuroimaging techniques show changes in brain activity that relate to the function of specific brain areas.. One technique is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which has the advantages over earlier methods of SPECT and PET of not needing the use of radioactive materials and of offering a higher resolution.
The hemispheres are connected by five commissures that span the longitudinal fissure, the largest of these is the corpus callosum.. The surface of the brain is folded into ridges (gyri) and grooves (sulci), many of which are named, usually according to their position, such as the frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe or the central sulcus separating the central regions of the hemispheres.
Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP.. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.The lateral hypothalamus contains orexinergic neurons that control appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system.
These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.
A characteristic of the brain is gyrification (wrinkling of the cortex).. In the womb, the cortex starts off as smooth but starts to form fissures that begin to mark out the different lobes of the brain.
The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.The hypothalamus in the diencephalon, is involved in regulating many functions of the body.. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake.
The brainstem continues below this as the spinal cord, protected by the vertebral column.
Ten of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves emerge directly from the brainstem.. The brainstem also contains many cranial nerve nuclei and nuclei of peripheral nerves, as well as nuclei involved in the regulation of many essential processes including breathing, control of eye movements and balance.
The pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise personality attributes to regions of the cortex in the 19th century.. In science fiction, brain transplants are imagined in tales such as the 1942 Donovan's Brain.


== Structure ==


=== Gross anatomy ===

The adult human brain weighs on average about 1.2–1.4 kg (2.6–3.1 lb) which is about 2% of the total body weight, with a volume of around 1260 cm3 in men and 1130 cm3 in women, although there is substantial individual variation.
In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed.. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon.
Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.Some treatments for stroke are time-critical.. These include clot dissolution or surgical removal of a clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes.
Differences in DNA, gene expression, and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of the human brain and other primates.

Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s.. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences.
The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research into a number of disorders.. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder.
Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.The tube flexes as it grows, forming the crescent-shaped cerebral hemispheres at the head.. The cerebral hemispheres first appear on day 32.
Early in the fourth week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure.
The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals, and hormone release by the digestive system.


=== Language ===

While language functions were traditionally thought to be localized to Wernicke's area and Broca's area, it is now mostly accepted that a wider network of cortical regions contributes to language functions.The study on how language is represented, processed, and acquired by the brain is called neurolinguistics, which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience, cognitive linguistics, and psycholinguistics.


=== Lateralisation ===

The cerebrum has a contralateral organisation with each hemisphere of the brain interacting primarily with one half of the body: the left side of the brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa.. The developmental cause for this is uncertain.
In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury.. Longer-term issues that may develop include posttraumatic stress disorder, and hydrocephalus.
The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata.. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres.
Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains.. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources.
Ralston, eds.. Davidson's principles and practice of medicine (21st ed.).
If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.
A substantial part of current understanding of the interactions between the two hemispheres has come from the study of "split-brain patients"—people who underwent surgical transection of the corpus callosum in an attempt to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures.. These patients do not show unusual behaviour that is immediately obvious, but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in the same body, with the right hand taking an action and then the left hand undoing it.
Pericytes play a major role in the formation of the tight junctions.. The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol).
It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body.. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head.
The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste).. Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated.From the skin, the brain receives information about fine touch, pressure, pain, vibration and temperature.
Vision from the left visual field is received on the right side of each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain.. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex.Hearing and balance are both generated in the inner ear.
The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain.. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa.
The reticular formation, a network of nuclei of ill-defined formation, is present within and along the length of the brainstem.. Many nerve tracts, which transmit information to and from the cerebral cortex to the rest of the body, pass through the brainstem.


=== Microanatomy ===
The human brain is primarily composed of neurons, glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels.
From the joints, the brain receives information about joint position.. The sensory cortex is found just near the motor cortex, and, like the motor cortex, has areas related to sensation from different body parts.
In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern.. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems.
Archangelo Piccolomini of Rome was the first to distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex.. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica.
The anterior and posterior lobes are connected in the middle by the vermis.. The cerebellum has a much thinner outer cortex that is narrowly furrowed horizontally.
Viewed from underneath between the two lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe.
Sleep may also have an effect on cognitive function by weakening unnecessary connections.


== Research ==
The brain is not fully understood, and research is ongoing.. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the human brain works.
Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem.. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other.
Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity.. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex.
One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches.. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries.
Astrocytes are the largest of the glial cells.. They are stellate cells with many processes radiating from their cell bodies.
Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons.. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron.
The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus.. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock.
Some sources include this with the basal ganglia.
Below and in front of the striatum are a number of basal forebrain structures.. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus.
Oxford: Oxford University Press.. ISBN 978-0-19-856878-0.
Purves, Dale (2012).
Proteins expressed in glial cells are astrocyte markers GFAP, and S100B.. Myelin basic protein, and the transcription factor, OLIG2 are expressed in oligodendrocytes.


=== Cerebrospinal fluid ===

Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colourless transcellular fluid that circulates around the brain in the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord.
In the 1820s, Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of damaging specific parts of animal brains describing the effects on movement and behavior.


=== Modern period ===

Studies of the brain became more sophisticated with the use of the microscope and the development of a silver staining method by Camillo Golgi during the 1880s.. This was able to show the intricate structures of single neurons.
Immediate problems may include bleeding within the brain, this may compress the brain tissue or damage its blood supply.. Bruising to the brain may occur.
Scientists do not have a clear answer as to why the cortex later wrinkles and folds, but the wrinkling and folding is associated with intelligence and neurological disorders.. The fissures form as a result of the growing hemispheres that increase in size due to a sudden growth in cells of the grey matter.
Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain.. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of each part of the brain.
In culture, the philosophy of mind has for centuries attempted to address the question of the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem.
Neurons link at synapses to form neural pathways, neural circuits, and large elaborate network systems such as the salience network and the default mode network, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.


=== Metabolism ===

The brain consumes up to 20% of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ.. In humans, blood glucose is the primary source of energy for most cells and is critical for normal function in a number of tissues, including the brain.
The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull.. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein.
The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head.. The papyrus mentions the external surface of the brain, the effects of injury (including seizures and aphasia), the meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid.In the fifth century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first considered the brain to be the seat of the mind.
Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.Mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and addiction, are known to relate to the functioning of the brain.. Treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy, psychiatry, social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy; the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals.Epileptic seizures are thought to relate to abnormal electrical activity.
The cortical layers of neurons constitute much of the brain's grey matter, while the deeper subcortical regions of myelinated axons, make up the white matter.


==== Cerebrum ====

The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain, and is divided into nearly symmetrical left and right hemispheres by a deep groove, the longitudinal fissure.. The outer part of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex, made up of grey matter arranged in layers.
Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.


=== Brain size ===

The size of the brain and a person's intelligence are not strongly related.. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ.
They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise.. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.The vertebral arteries emerge as branches of the left and right subclavian arteries.
It is not true that neurons are not replaced after the age of two; nor that only ten per cent of the brain is used.. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific to one side of the brain or the other.
The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.
The brain is protected by the skull, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier.. However, the brain is still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection.
Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated.. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs.
Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood.. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans.
These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves.. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements.
Testing for reflexes can be of help in the decision, as can the absence of response and breathing.. Clinical observations, including a total lack of responsiveness, a known diagnosis, and neural imaging evidence, may all play a role in the decision to pronounce brain death.


== Society and culture ==
Neuroanthropology is the study of the relationship between culture and the brain.
The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared to be involved in generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience.. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.


=== Cognition ===
 
The brain is responsible for cognition, which functions through numerous processes and executive functions.The use of fuzzy logic is especially relevant in gene regulatory networks, as the modeling of protein binding strength often requires non-binary variables.


=== Types of learning ===
Artificial Neural Networks designed to simulate of the human brain require an ability to learn a variety of tasks that is not required by those designed to accomplish a specific task.. Supervised learning is a mechanism by which an artificial neural network can learn by receiving a number of inputs with a correct output already known.
Among those diseases suggested as being possible targets of computational neurogenetic modeling based analysis are epilepsy, schizophrenia, mental retardation, brain aging and Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

To determine the output, a transfer function (or activation function) evaluates the sum of the weighted signals and, in some artificial neural networks, their input rate.. Signal weights are strengthened (long-term potentiation) or weakened (long-term depression) depending on how synchronous the presynaptic and postsynaptic activation rates are (Hebbian theory).The synaptic activity of individual neurons is modeled using equations to determine the temporal (and in some 
cases, spatial) summation of synaptic signals, membrane potential, threshold for action potential 
generation, the absolute and relative refractory period, and optionally ion receptor channel kinetics and Gaussian noise (to increase biological accuracy by incorporation of random elements).
In addition to connectivity, some types of artificial neural networks, such as spiking neural networks, also model the distance between neurons, and its effect on the synaptic weight (the strength of a synaptic transmission).


=== Combining gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks ===
For the parameters in the gene regulatory network to affect the neurons in the artificial neural network as intended there must be some connection between them.. In an organizational context, each node (neuron) in the artificial neural network has its own gene regulatory network associated with it.
Computational neurogenetic modeling (CNGM) is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.. These include neural network models and their integration with gene network models.
The typical process for using genetic algorithms to refine a gene 
regulatory network is: first, create a population; next, to create offspring via a crossover operation and 
evaluate their fitness; then, on a group chosen for high fitness, simulate mutation via a mutation operator; 
finally, taking the now mutated group, repeat this process until a desired level of fitness is demonstrated.


=== Evolving systems ===
Methods by which artificial neural networks may alter their structure without simulated mutation and fitness selection have been developed.. A dynamically evolving neural network is one approach, as the creation of new connections and new neurons can 
be modeled as the system adapts to new data.
Genes and proteins are modeled as individual nodes, and the interactions that influence a gene are modeled as excitatory (increases gene/protein expression) or inhibitory (decreases gene/protein expression) inputs that are weighted to reflect the effect a gene or protein is having on another gene or protein.. Gene regulatory networks are typically designed using data from microarrays.Modeling of genes and proteins allows individual responses of neurons in an artificial neural network that mimic responses in biological nervous systems, such as division (adding new neurons to the artificial neural network), creation of proteins to expand their cell membrane and foster neurite outgrowth (and thus stronger connections with other neurons), up-regulate or down-regulate receptors at synapses (increasing or decreasing the weight (strength) of synaptic inputs), uptake more neurotransmitters, change into different types of neurons, or die due to necrosis or apoptosis.
To accomplish this, constructive artificial neural networks that are able to grow or shrink to adapt to inputs are often used.. Evolving connectionist systems are a subtype of constructive artificial neural networks (evolving in this case referring to changing the structure of its neural network rather than by mutation and natural selection).


=== Randomness ===
Both synaptic transmission and gene-protein interactions are stochastic in nature.
This can take place during the training of the network, referred to as online aggregation, or between periods of training, referred to as offline aggregation.. Experiments have suggested that offline aggregation is more efficient.


== Potential applications ==
A variety of potential applications have been suggested for accurate computational neurogenetic models, such as simulating genetic diseases, examining the impact of potential treatments, better understanding of learning and cognition, and development of hardware able to interface with neurons.The simulation of disease states is of particular interest, as modeling both the neurons and their genes and proteins allows linking genetic mutations and protein abnormalities to pathological effects in the central nervous system.
Those that do, such as spiking neural networks, fire only when the pooled inputs reach a membrane potential is reached.. Because this mimics the firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks are viewed as a more biologically accurate model of synaptic activity.


=== Growth and shrinkage ===
To accurately model the central nervous system, creation and death of neurons should be modeled as well.
The speed at which the NMDA receptor lets Calcium ions into the cell in response to Glutamate is an important determinant of Long-term potentiation via the insertion of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) into the plasma membrane at the synapse of the postsynaptic cell (the cell that receives the neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell).


=== Genetic regulatory network ===

In most models of neural systems neurons are the most basic unit modeled.. In computational neurogenetic modeling, to better simulate processes that are responsible for synaptic activity and connectivity, the genes responsible are modeled for each neuron.
A gene regulatory network, protein regulatory network, or gene/protein regulatory network, is the level of processing in a computational neurogenetic model that models the interactions of genes and proteins relevant to synaptic activity and general cell functions.
This enables the network to evolve in modeling accuracy without simulated natural selection.. One method by which dynamically evolving networks may be optimized, called evolving layer neuron aggregation, combines neurons with sufficiently similar input weights into one neuron.
In both cases the output of the network is measured against known biological data using some function, and subsequent improvements are made by altering the structure of the network.. A common test of accuracy for artificial neural networks is to compare some parameter of the model to data acquired from biological neural systems, such as from an EEG.
Individual neurons are the basic unit of an artificial neural network, with each neuron acting as a node.. Each node receives weighted signals from other nodes that are either excitatory or inhibitory.
This area brings together knowledge from various scientific disciplines, such as computer and information science, neuroscience and cognitive science, genetics and molecular biology, as well as engineering.


== Levels of processing ==


=== Molecular kinetics ===
Models of the kinetics of proteins and ion channels associated with neuron activity represent the lowest level of modeling in a computational neurogenetic model.. The altered activity of proteins in some diseases, such as the amyloid beta protein in Alzheimer's disease, must be modeled at the molecular level to accurately predict the effect on cognition.
Biological data is often unable to be processed using Boolean logic, and moreover accurate modeling of the capabilities of biological nervous systems requires fuzzy logic.. Therefore, artificial neural networks that incorporate it, such as evolving fuzzy neural networks (EFuNN) or Dynamic Evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference Systems (DENFIS), are often used in computational neurogenetic modeling.
To model biological nervous systems with greater fidelity some form of randomness is often introduced into the network.. Artificial neural networks modified in this manner are often labeled as probabilistic versions of their neural network sub-type (e.g., pSNN).


=== Incorporation of fuzzy logic ===
Fuzzy logic is a system of reasoning that enables an artificial neural network to deal in non-binary and linguistic variables.
The creation and analysis of these networks can be divided into two sub-areas of research: the 
gene up-regulation that is involved in the normal functions of a neuron, such as growth, metabolism, and synapsing; and the effects of mutated genes on neurons and cognitive functions.


=== Artificial neural network ===

An artificial neural network generally refers to any computational model that mimics the central nervous system, with capabilities such as learning and pattern recognition.. With regards to computational neurogenetic modeling, however, it is often used to refer to those specifically designed for biological accuracy rather than computational efficiency.
A genetic algorithm is a process that can be used to refine models by mimicking the process of natural selection observed in biological ecosystems.. The primary advantages are that, due to not requiring derivative information, it can be applied to black box problems and multimodal optimization.
In the case of EEG recordings, the local field potential (LFP) of the artificial neural network is taken and compared to EEG data acquired from human patients.. The relative intensity ratio (RIRs) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the EEG are compared with those generated by the artificial neural networks to determine the accuracy of the model.


=== Genetic algorithm ===

Because the amount of data on the interplay of genes and neurons and their effects is not enough to construct a rigorous model, 
evolutionary computation is used to optimize artificial neural networks and gene regulatory networks, a common technique being the genetic algorithm.Biologically relevant models such as  Hopfield net have been developed to address the properties of associative (also known as "content-addressable") style of memory that occur in biological systems.. These attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium- and long-term memory, localizing in the hippocampus.

Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.The computational functions of complex dendrites are also under intense investigation.. There is a large body of literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties of neurons.Some models are also tracking biochemical pathways at very small scales such as spines or synaptic clefts.
There are many software packages, such as  GENESIS and NEURON, that allow rapid and systematic in silico modeling of realistic neurons.

=== Consciousness ===
One of the ultimate goals of psychology/neuroscience is to be able to explain the everyday experience of conscious life.. Francis Crick and Christof Koch made some attempts to formulate a consistent framework for future work in neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), though much of the work in this field remains speculative.


=== Computational clinical neuroscience ===
Computational Clinical Neuroscience is a field that brings together experts in neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, decision sciences and computational modeling to quantitatively define and investigate problems in neurological and psychiatric diseases, and to train scientists and clinicians that wish to apply these models to diagnosis and treatment.

Stereochemically detailed models of the acetylcholine receptor-based synapse with the Monte Carlo method, working at the time scale of microseconds, have been built.. It is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to our understanding of how synapses function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades.


=== Behaviors of networks ===
Biological neurons are connected to each other in a complex, recurrent fashion.
With the emergence of two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging, we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks.
In some cases the complex interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons can be simplified using mean field theory, which gives rise to the population model of neural networks.. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural functional relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible.

The term mathematical neuroscience is also used sometimes, to stress the quantitative nature of the field.The mathematical models formulated in computational neuroscience are useful since they capture the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, proteins, and chemical coupling to network oscillations, columnar and topographic architecture, and learning and memory.. Furthermore, these computational models frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments.


== History ==
The term 'computational neuroscience' was introduced by Eric L.
As a result, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse with an artificially simple model, ignoring much of the biological detail.. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead.
Experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis in one form or another.
Current research in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modelling of different subsystems and a more theoretical modelling of perception.. Current models of perception have suggested that the brain performs some form of Bayesian inference and integration of different sensory information in generating our perception of the physical world.


=== Memory and synaptic plasticity ===

Earlier models of memory are primarily based on the postulates of Hebbian learning.
Schwartz, who organized a conference, held in 1985 in Carmel, California, at the request of the Systems Development Foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names, such as neural modeling, brain theory and neural networks.. The proceedings of this definitional meeting were published in 1990 as the book Computational Neuroscience.

Computational modeling of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of Wilfrid Rall, with the first multicompartmental model using cable theory.


== Major topics ==
Research in computational neuroscience can be roughly categorized into several lines of inquiry.. Most computational neuroscientists collaborate closely with experimentalists in analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models of biological phenomena.


=== Single-neuron modeling ===

Even single neurons have complex biophysical characteristics and can perform computations (e.g.).
One of the key goals of computational neuroscience is to dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes in building intelligent machines.
The brain's large-scale organizational principles are illuminated by many fields, including biology, psychology, and clinical practice.. Integrative neuroscience attempts to consolidate these observations through unified descriptive models and databases of behavioral measures and recordings.
One hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention is the minimal wiring hypothesis, which postulates that the formation of axons and dendrites effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information storage.


=== Sensory processing ===
Early models of sensory processing understood within a theoretical framework are credited to Horace Barlow.. Somewhat similar to the minimal wiring hypothesis described in the preceding section, Barlow understood the processing of the early sensory systems to be a form of  efficient coding, where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number of spikes.

Schutter, Erik de (2001).
Lapicque introduced the integrate and fire model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907.. This model is still popular today for artificial neural networks studies because of its simplicity (see a recent review).
About 40 years later, Hodgkin & Huxley developed the voltage clamp and created the first biophysical model of the action potential.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.Other scholars furthered Vesalius' work by adding their own detailed sketches of the human brain.. René Descartes also studied the physiology of the brain, proposing the theory of dualism to tackle the issue of the brain's relation to the mind.
In ancient Egypt, from the late Middle Kingdom onwards, in preparation for mummification, the brain was regularly removed, for it was the heart that was assumed to be the seat of intelligence.. According to Herodotus, during the first step of mummification: "The most perfect practice is to extract as much of the brain as possible with an iron hook, and what the hook cannot reach is mixed with drugs." Over the next five thousand years, this view came to be reversed; the brain is now known to be the seat of intelligence, although colloquial variations of the former remain as in "memorizing something by heart".


== Early views ==

The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, written in the 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain.
Carl Wernicke further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production.. Modern research still uses the Korbinian Brodmann's cytoarchitectonic (referring to study of cell structure) anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks.
From the ancient Egyptian mummifications to 18th century scientific research on "globules" and neurons, there is evidence of neuroscience practice throughout the early periods of history.. The early civilizations lacked adequate means to obtain knowledge about the human brain.
This contains the governing faculty.. All the senses are connected in some way with the brain; consequently they are incapable of action if the brain is disturbed...the power of the brain to synthesize sensations makes it also the seat of thought: The storing up of perceptions gives memory and belief and when these are stabilized you get knowledge." In the 4th century BC Hippocrates, believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence (based, among others before him, on Alcmaeon's work).
He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid.. Thomas Willis studied the brain, nerves, and behavior to develop neurologic treatments.
Richard Caton presented his findings in 1875 about electrical phenomena of the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys.. Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during the late 1890s that used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of single neurons.
While the symptoms are well written and detailed, the absence of a medical precedent is apparent.. The author of the passage notes "the pulsations of the exposed brain" and compared the surface of the brain to the rippling surface of copper slag (which indeed has a gyral-sulcal pattern).
Herophilus not only distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, but provided the first clear description of the ventricles.. Erasistratus used practical application by experimenting on the living brain.
The laterality of injury was related to the laterality of symptom, and both aphasia ("he speaks not to thee") and seizures ("he shutters exceedingly") after head injury were described.. Observations by ancient civilizations of the human brain suggest only a relative understanding of the basic mechanics and the importance of cranial security.
For the next advance in understanding spinal function we must await Bell and Magendie in the 19th Century."


== Middle Ages ==
Circa 1000, Al-Zahrawi, living in Islamic Iberia, evaluated neurological patients and performed surgical treatments of head injuries, skull fractures, spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural effusions and headache.. Concurrently in Persia, Avicenna also presented detailed knowledge about skull fractures and their surgical treatments.
He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed.. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.
Nervous Acts: Essays on Literature, Culture and Sensibility.. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.
The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two patients, wounded in the head, who had compound fractures of the skull.. The assessments of the author (a battlefield surgeon) of the papyrus allude to ancient Egyptians having a vague recognition of the effects of head trauma.

Furthermore, considering the general consensus of medical practice pertaining to human anatomy was based on myths and superstition, the thoughts of the battlefield surgeon appear to be empirical and based on logical deduction and simple observation.During the second half of the first millennium BC, the Ancient Greeks developed differing views on the function of the brain.. However, due to the fact that Hippocratic doctors did not practice dissection, because the human body was considered sacred, Greek views of brain function were generally uninformed by anatomical study.

Their assumptions about the inner workings of the mind, therefore, were not accurate.. Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a form of "cranial stuffing" of sorts.
His technique was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron.. Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain.
"Further, his studies of the cranial nerves and spinal cord were outstanding.. He noted that specific spinal nerves controlled specific muscles, and had the idea of the reciprocal action of muscles.
The hypotheses of the neuron doctrine were supported by experiments following Galvani's pioneering work in the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons.. In the late 19th century, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Johannes Peter Müller, and Hermann von Helmholtz showed neurons were electrically excitable and that their activity predictably affected the electrical state of adjacent neurons.
In parallel with this research, work with brain-damaged patients by Paul Broca suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions.


== Twentieth century ==
Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, rather than studies of the nervous system being a factor of science belonging to a variety of disciplines.
Broca's hypothesis was supported by observations of epileptic patients conducted by John Hughlings Jackson, who correctly deduced the organization of motor cortex by watching the progression of seizures through the body.

As the number of databases that seek to disseminate information about the structure, development and function of the brain has grown, so has the need to collate these resources themselves.. As a result, there now exist databases of neuroscience databases, some of which reach over 3000 entries.

A number of online neuroscience databases are available which provide information regarding gene expression, neurons, macroscopic brain structure, and neurological or psychiatric disorders.. Some databases contain descriptive and numerical data, some to brain function, others offer access to 'raw' imaging data, such as postmortem brain sections or 3D MRI and fMRI images.The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell.. The axons of these cells descend from the cortex to form the corticospinal tract.


=== Nerve tracts ===
Nerve tracts are bundles of axons as white matter, that carry action potentials to their effectors.
One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate.


==== Neuromuscular Junction ====
The interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction.. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane.
Transcription factors here include Pax6, OLIG2, Nkx-6.1, and Nkx-6.2, which are regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh).. The OLIG2 gene being the most important due to its role in promoting Ngn2 expression, a gene that causes cell cycle exiting as well as promoting further transcription factors associated with motor neuron development.Further specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, Wnts, and TGFb, are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors.
Muscle relaxation and inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by inhibition of the motor neuron itself.. This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that innervate muscles (by decreasing their electrophysiological activity) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions, rather than on the muscles themselves.


=== Special visceral motor neurons ===
These are also known as branchial motor neurons, which are involved in facial expression, mastication, phonation, and swallowing.
It is this chemical release that causes the target muscle fiber to contract.In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory.. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile.
They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.

Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle.. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells.
Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks-Cole.. ISBN 0-534-37254-6.
Marieb, E.
The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate).. This homeodomain is known as the motor neural progenitor domain (pMN).
The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching.. This process is also called the stretch reflex.

Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles, with collaterals to extrafusal fibres.
The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and triggers a muscle action potential.. T tubules of the sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
There are two types of gamma motor neurons:   Dynamic- These focus on Bag1 fibers and enhance dynamic sensitivity.. Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity.
Regulatory factors of lower motor neurons
Size Principle – this relates to the soma of the motor neuron.
An alternate way to think of this is that the post-synaptic neuron is being primed before receiving an impulse.
After Hyper-polarization (AHP) – we are all familiar with the idea of hyperpolarization after an action potential.. A trend has been identified that shows slow motor neurons to have more intense AHPs for a longer duration.
They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching.. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex.
They gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence don't require oxygen.. They are called white fibers.
Fast fatigue-resistant motor units stimulate moderate-sized muscles groups that don't react as fast as the FF motor units, but can be sustained much longer (as implied by the name) and provide more force than S motor units.
N.; Mallatt, J.. (1997).
These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy.In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching.. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS.
A tetanic contraction is caused by constant, very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come at such a rapid rate that individual twitches are indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.


== Development ==
Motor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood.. In the neural tube cells are specified to either the rostral-caudal axis or ventral-dorsal axis.
A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.. There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons.
In the spinal cord these descending tracts carry impulses from different regions.. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons.
ISBN 0-8053-4068-8.
In summation, the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch.. The twitches thus superimpose on one another, leading to a force greater than that of a single twitch.
Motor units are split up into 3 categories: Main Article: Motor Unit
Slow (S) motor units stimulate small muscle fibers, which contract very slowly and provide small amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue, so they are used to sustain muscular contraction, such as keeping the body upright.. They gain their energy via oxidative means and hence require oxygen.
There are three primary categories lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories.According to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:
Somatic motor neurons
Special visceral motor neurons
General visceral motor neurons


=== Somatic motor neurons ===
Somatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles  (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion.. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons.
(2001).. Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems (4th ed.).
There are seven major descending motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord:
Lateral corticospinal tract
Rubrospinal tract
Lateral reticulospinal tract
Vestibulospinal tract
Medial reticulospinal tract
Tectospinal tract
Anterior corticospinal tract


=== Lower Motor Neurons ===
Lower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets.. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber.
There are 13 Hox transcription factors and along with the signals, determine whether a motor neuron will be more rostral or caudal in character.. In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns.

=== Upper motor neurons ===
Upper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex  located in the precentral gyrus.
There are two types of beta motor neurons:          Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers.. Fast Contracting- These innervate intrafusal fibers.
Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers found within the muscle spindle.
A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average.. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit.
Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons.. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.Terms in the standard vocabulary have been selected for ease of pronunciation, mnemonic value, and frequency of use in recent neuroscientific publications.. Structures and their relations to each other are defined in terms of the standard vocabulary.

Overview of NeuroNames
BrainInfo
NeuroNames Direct LinkThe delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works.. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or "lesions" to specific brain areas affects behavior or other neural functions.
For information about the composition of non-human animal nervous systems, see nervous system.
The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 90 degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the forebrain and the brainstem and spinal cord.. This change in axial dimension is problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain.
Medial and lateral: medial refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor median means a position precisely at the midline.
Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis.. The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis.
A coronal plane across the head and brain is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the etymology refers to corona or crown; the plane in which a king's crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the coronal suture of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face).
Both neurons and glial cells come in many types (see, for example, the nervous system section of the list of distinct cell types in the adult human body).. Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters across synapses, and produce our memories, thoughts and movements.
Drosophila is being used as a genetic model for several human neurological diseases including the neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson's, Huntington's, spinocerebellar ataxia and Alzheimer's disease.. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many basic aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics have turned out to be relevant to humans.
Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information has been used to enable a multitude of studies that would not have been possible without it.


=== Drosophila melanogaster ===

Drosophila melanogaster is a popular experimental animal because it is easily cultured en masse from the wild, has a short generation time, and mutant animals are readily obtainable.
Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing.. The brain of a fruit fly contains several million synapses, compared to at least 100 billion in the human brain.
Nerves are made primarily of the axons of neurons, along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into nerve fascicles.
The vertebrate nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems.. The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain, retina, and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of all the nerves outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body.
An example of a tracer virus which replicates from the synapse to the soma is the pseudorabies virus.. By using pseudorabies viruses with different fluorescent reporters, dual infection models can parse complex synaptic architecture.


=== Dye-based methods ===
Axonal transport methods use a variety of dyes (horseradish peroxidase variants, fluorescent or radioactive markers, lectins, dextrans) that are more or less avidly absorbed by neurons or their processes.
An important example is diffusion tensor imaging, which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images.. In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure.


=== Viral-based methods ===
Certain viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses.
Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections.. Due to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face).According to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.


== Tools ==
Modern developments in neuroanatomy are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform research.
Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system.. For example, the C.
One advantage of working with this worm is that  the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm.. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed every section under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body, to give a complete connectome of the nematode.
The autonomic nervous system also has two subdivisions, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, which are important for regulating the body's basic internal organ functions such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation.. Autonomic nerves, like somatic nerves, contain afferent and efferent fibers.


=== Orientation in neuroanatomy ===

In anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, several sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis (see Anatomical terms of location).
This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy.
Immunocytochemistry is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters.. Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein.
The nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied because of its importance in genetics.. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model system for studying the way that genes control development, including neuronal development.
Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available.. Many of the histological techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well.
The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are:

Dorsal and ventral: dorsal loosely refers to the top or upper side, and ventral to the bottom or lower side.. These descriptors originally referred to dorsum and ventrum – back and belly – of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior.
The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.. The somatic nervous system is made up of "afferent" neurons, which bring sensory information from the sense organs to the CNS, and "efferent" neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the muscles.
The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis – that of the primordial elongated neural tube – which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above.. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground.
elegans nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next.. This has allowed researchers using electron microscopy to map the paths and connections of all of the approximately 300 neurons in this species.
Lateral is the opposite (a position separated away from the midline)).Note that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally).
Commonly used terms for planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy are "sagittal", "transverse" or "coronal", and "axial" or "horizontal".. Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or quadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis.

A mid-sagittal plane divides the body and brain into left and right halves; sagittal sections in general are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension(see the image above).
For instance, the first biological clock genes were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles.

=== Computational neuroanatomy ===

Is a field that utilizes various imaging modalities and computational techniques to model and quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuroanatomical structures in both normal and clinical populations.


== Model systems ==
Aside from the human brain, there are many other animals whose brains and nervous systems have received extensive study as model systems, including mice, zebrafish, fruit fly, and a species of roundworm called C.. elegans.
So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses.. Two tracer viruses which replicate and spread transneuronal/transsynaptic are the Herpes simplex virus type1 (HSV) and the Rhabdoviruses.
Approximately two-thirds of the Drosophila brain is dedicated to visual processing.
Thomas Hunt Morgan started to work with Drosophila in 1906, and  this work earned him the 1933 Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes.. Because of the large array of tools available for studying Drosophila genetics,  they have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in the nervous system.
This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -dendrites, axon- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells.. Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.


=== Histochemistry ===
Histochemistry uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (including notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes.
The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not properly extend into the head, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element.. Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth cavity, are called ventral – i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above – whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault.
Rostral and caudal: rostral refers to the front of the body (towards the nose, or rostrum in Latin), and caudal to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; cauda in Latin).
The genome has been sequenced and published in 2000.. About 75% of known human disease genes have a recognizable match in the genome of fruit flies.
Their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood.. In vertebrates, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the brain and spinal cord (together called the central nervous system, or CNS) and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body (known as the peripheral nervous system, or PNS).
Herpes simplex virus was used to trace the connections between the brain and the stomach, in order to examine the brain areas involved in viscero-sensory processing.. Another study injected herpes simplex virus into the eye, thus allowing the visualization of the optical pathway from the retina into the visual system.
Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy.


=== Connectomics ===

Serial section electron microscopy has been extensively developed for use in studying nervous systems.. For example, the first application of serial block-face scanning electron microscopy was on rodent cortical tissue.
However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts.. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely coronal sections.
These molecules are selectively transported anterogradely (from soma to axon terminals) or retrogradely (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain.. These 'physiologic' methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons.
The extracellular matrix also provides support on the molecular level for the brain's cells.
At the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the hippocampus in mammals or the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly.. These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general pathways of the nervous system.
Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce myelin, and provide support and protection for the brain's neurons.. Some glial cells (astrocytes) can even propagate intercellular calcium waves over long distances in response to stimulation, and release gliotransmitters in response to changes in calcium concentration.
The next major development in neuroanatomy came from the Greek Alcmaeon, who determined that the brain and not the heart ruled the body and that the senses were dependent on the brain.After Alcmaeon’s findings, many scientists, philosophers, and physicians from around the world continued to contribute to the understanding of neuroanatomy, notably: Galen, Herophilus, Rhazes and Erasistratus.. Herophilus and Erasistratus of Alexandria were perhaps the most influential Greek neuroscientists with their studies involving dissecting the brains.
Neuroanatomy is the study of the structure and organization of the nervous system.. In contrast to animals with radial symmetry, whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with bilateral symmetry have segregated, defined nervous systems.
In Man, the directional terms "superior" and "inferior" essentially refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body axis is roughly  oriented vertically in the erect position.. However, all vertebrates develop a kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the cephalic flexure.
This immensely increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia) in various regions of the nervous system.
In situ hybridization uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein.. This allows identification histologically (in situ) of the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations.


=== Genetically encoded markers ===
By expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called "brainbow" mutant mouse allows the combinatorial visualization of many different colors in neurons.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the formation of new declarative memories, and it has been theorized that the reason human infants cannot form declarative memories is because they are still undergoing extensive neurogenesis in the hippocampus and their memory-generating circuits are immature.. Many environmental factors, such as exercise, stress, and antidepressants have been reported to change the rate of neurogenesis within the hippocampus of rodents.
In some vertebrates, regenerative neurogenesis has also been shown to occur.

Article: Nature Medicine 4, 1313 - 1317 (1998) doi:10.1038/3305 Neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus
Most of these adult neural stem cells lie dormant in the adult, but in response to certain signals, these dormant cells, or B cells, go through a series of stages, first producing proliferating cells, or C cells.. The C cells then produce neuroblasts, or A cells, that will become neurons.


==== Hippocampus ====
Significant neurogenesis also occurs during adulthood in the hippocampus of many mammals, from rodents to some primates, although its existence in adult humans is debated.
However, neurogenesis doesn't begin until a sufficient population of NSCs has been achieved.. These early stem cells are called neuroepithelial cells (NEC)s, but soon take on a highly elongated radial morphology and are then known as radial glial cells (RGC)s.
The majority of those interneurons are inhibitory granule cells, but a small number are periglomerular cells.. In the adult SVZ, the primary neural stem cells are SVZ astrocytes rather than RGCs.
In contrast, neurogenesis in humans generally begins around gestational week (GW) 10 and ends around GW 25 with birth about GW 38-40.


=== Adult neurogenesis ===
Adult neurogenesis has been shown to occur at low levels compared with development, and in only two regions of the brain: the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of the striatum, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.


==== Subventricular zone ====
In many mammals, including for example rodents, the olfactory bulb is a brain region containing cells that detect smell, featuring integration of adult-born neurons, which migrate from the SVZ of the striatum to the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream (RMS).. The migrating neuroblasts in the olfactory bulb become interneurons that help the brain communicate with these sensory cells.
Neurogenesis is the process by which nervous system cells, known as neurons, are produced by neural stem cells (NSC)s, and it occurs in all species of animals except the porifera (sponges) and placozoans.. Types of NSCs include neuroepithelial cells (NECs), radial glial cells (RGCs), basal progenitors (BPs), intermediate neuronal precursors (INP)s, subventricular zone astrocytes, and subgranular zone radial astrocytes, among others.
First, this may generate a subclass of neuronal progenitors called intermediate neuronal precursors (INP)s, which will divide one or more additional times to produce neurons.. Alternatively, daughter neurons may be produced directly.
Neurons do not immediately form neural circuits through the growth of axons and dendrites.. Instead, newborn neurons must first migrate long distances to their final destinations, maturing and finally generating neural circuitry.
These factors notably include the Notch signaling pathway, and many genes have been linked to Notch pathway regulation.. The genes and mechanisms involved in regulating neurogenesis are the subject of intensive research in academic, pharmaceutical, and government settings worldwide.
The amount of time required to generate all the neurons of the CNS varies widely across mammals, and brain neurogenesis is not always complete by the time of birth.
For example, neurons born in the ventricular zone migrate radially to the cortical plate, which is where neurons accumulate to form the cerebral cortex.. Thus, the generation of neurons occurs in a specific tissue compartment or 'neurogenic niche' occupied by their parent stem cells.
The rate of neurogenesis and the type of neuron generated (broadly, excitatory or inhibitory) are principally determined by molecular and genetic factors.
For example, mice undergo cortical neurogenesis from about embryonic day (post-conceptional day) (E)11 to E17, and are born at about E19.5.. Ferrets are born at E42, although their period of cortical neurogenesis does not end until a few days after birth.If any of these genes are improperly regulated, then proper formation and differentiation will not occur.. 
BMP also plays a very important role in the patterning that occurs after the formation of the neural tube.
Behavioral and cognitive areas of research continue to expand in an effort to pinpoint contributing genetic factors.. As a result of the expanding neurogenetics field a better understanding of specific neurological disorders and phenotypes has arisen with direct correlation to genetic mutations.
This conservation of behavior across species has led biologists to hypothesize that these traits could possibly have similar, if not the same, genetic causes and pathways.. Studies conducted on the genomes of a plethora of organisms have revealed that many organisms have homologous genes, meaning that some genetic material has been conserved between species.
Due to the graded response the cells of the neural tube have to BMP and Shh signaling, these pathways are in competition to determine the fate of preneural cells.. BMP promotes dorsal differentiation of pre-neural cells into sensory neurons and Shh promotes ventral differentiation into motor neurons.
This process is referred to sometimes as linkage analysis.. By the 1990s ever advancing technology had made genetic analysis more feasible and available.
Due to their low-maintenance and highly mapped genomes, mice, Drosophila, and C.. elegans are very common.
New developments such as the genome wide association studies (GWAS) have brought vast new resources within grasp.. With this new information genetic variability within the human population and possibly linked diseases can be more readily discerned.
There are many other genes that help to determine neural fate and proper development include, RELN, SOX9, WNT, Notch and Delta coding genes, HOX, and various cadherin coding genes like CDH1 and CDH2.Some recent research has shown that the level of gene expression changes drastically in the brain at different periods throughout the life cycle.. For example, during prenatal development the amount of mRNA in the brain (an indicator of gene expression) is exceptionally high, and drops to a significantly lower level not long after birth.
Neurodegenerative diseases are a more common subset of neurological disorders, with examples being Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.. Currently no viable treatments exist that actually reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases; however, neurogenetics is emerging as one field that might yield a causative connection.
Along with gathering some basic information about medical history and the extent of their symptoms, samples are taken from the participants, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and/or muscle tissue.. These tissue samples are then genetically sequenced, and the genomes are added to current database collections.
The growth of these data bases will eventually allow researchers to better understand the genetic nuances of these conditions and bring therapy treatments closer to reality.. Current areas of interest in this field have a wide range, spanning anywhere from the maintenance of circadian rhythms, the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, the persistence of periodic disorders, and the effects of mitochondrial decay on metabolism.


== Behavioral neurogenetics ==

Advances in molecular biology techniques and the species-wide genome project have made it possible to map out an individual's entire genome.
These animals are then classically conditioned to perform certain types of tasks, such as pulling a lever in order to gain a reward.. The speed of their learning, the retention of the learned behavior, and other factors are then compared to the results of healthy organisms to determine what kind of an effect – if any – the mutation has had on these higher processes.
Many of the disorders studied early on including Alzheimer’s, Huntington's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are still at the center of much research to this day.. By the late 1980s new advances in genetics such as recombinant DNA technology and reverse genetics allowed for the broader use of DNA polymorphisms to test for linkage between DNA and gene defects.
The discovery of linkages could then lead to therapeutic drugs, which could reverse brain degeneration.


== Gene sequencing ==
One of the most noticeable results of further research into neurogenetics is a greater knowledge of gene loci that show linkage to neurological diseases.. The table below represents a sampling of specific gene locations identified to play a role in selected neurological diseases based on prevalence in the United States.


== Methods of research ==


=== Statistical analysis ===
Logarithm of odds (LOD) is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of gene linkage between traits.
In forward genetics, an organism with a particular phenotype is identified first, and its genotype is then analyzed.


=== Animal research ===

Model organisms are an important tool in many areas of research, including the field of neurogenetics.. By studying creatures with simpler nervous systems and with smaller genomes, scientists can better understand their biological processes and apply them to more complex organisms, such as humans.
The field of neurogenetics emerged in the mid to late 1900s with advances closely following advancements made in available technology.. Currently, neurogenetics is the center of much research utilizing cutting edge techniques.


== History ==
The field of neurogenetics emerged from advances made in molecular biology, genetics and a desire to understand the link between genes, behavior, the brain, and neurological disorders and diseases.
Zebrafish and prairie voles have also become more common, especially in the social and behavioral scopes of neurogenetics.
In addition to examining how genetic mutations affect the actual structure of the brain, researchers in neurogenetics also examine how these mutations affect cognition and behavior.. One method of examining this involves purposely engineering model organisms with mutations of certain genes of interest.
This decade saw a marked increase in identifying the specific role genes played in relation to neurological disorders.. Advancements were made in but not limited to: Fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, epilepsy and ALS.


== Neurological disorders ==
While the genetic basis of simple diseases and disorders has been accurately pinpointed, the genetics behind more complex, neurological disorders is still a source of ongoing research.
He also started conducting research in neurodegeneration in fruit flies in an attempt to discover ways to suppress neurological diseases in humans.. Many of the techniques he used and conclusions he drew would drive the field forward.Early analysis relied on statistical interpretation through processes such as LOD (logarithm of odds) scores of pedigrees and other observational methods such as affected sib-pairs, which looks at phenotype and IBD (identity by descent) configuration.
The field started to expand in the 1960s through the research of Seymour Benzer, considered by some to be the father of neurogenetics.. His pioneering work with Drosophila helped to elucidate the link between circadian rhythms and genes, which led to further investigations into other behavior traits.

With severe disorders such as epilepsy, brain malformations, or mental retardation a single gene or causative condition has been identified 60% of the time; however, the milder the intellectual handicap the lower chance a specific genetic cause has been pinpointed.. Autism for example is only linked to a specific, mutated gene about 15–20% of the time while the mildest forms of mental handicaps are only being accounted for genetically less than 5% of the time.
It is used to make alterations to an organism’s genome, usually causing it to over- or under-express a certain gene of interest, or express a mutated form of it.. The results of these experiments can provide information on that gene’s role in the organism’s body, and it importance in survival and fitness.
Throughout the animal kingdom, varying styles, types and levels of aggression can be observed leading scientists to believe that there might be a genetic contribution that has conserved this particular behavioral trait.. For some species varying levels of aggression have indeed exhibited direct correlation to a higher level of Darwinian fitness.


== Development ==
 A great deal of research has been done on the effects of genes and the formation of the brain and the central nervous system.
By identifying specific genetic markers for the genes of interest in a recombinant inbred strain, the amount of interaction between these genes and their relation to the observed phenotype can be determined through complex statistical analysis.. 
In a neurogenetics laboratory, the phenotype of a model organisms is observed by assessing the morphology of their brain through thin slices.
Due to fact that many behavioral characteristics have been conserved across species for generations, researchers are able to use animal subjects such as mice and rats, but also fruit flies, worms, and zebrafish, to try to determine specific genes that correlate to behavior and attempt to match these with human genes.


=== Cross-species gene conservation ===
While it is true that variation between species can appear to be pronounced, at their most basic they share many similar behavior traits which are necessary for survival.. Such traits include mating, aggression, foraging, social behavior and sleep patterns.
There is little to no evidence to suggest that the presence of a single gene indicates that an individual will express one style of behavior over another; rather, having a specific gene could make one more predisposed to displaying this type of behavior.. It is starting to become clear that most genetically influenced behaviors are due to the effects of many variants within many genes, in addition to other neurological regulating factors like neurotransmitter levels.
Whether genetic or environmental factors are primarily responsible for an individual's personality has long been a topic of debate.. Thanks to the advances being made in the field of neurogenetics, researchers have begun to tackle this question by beginning to map out genes and correlate them to different personality traits.
Mutations in this genetic sequence can have a wide range of effects on the quality of life of the individual.. Neurological diseases, behavior and personality are all studied in the context of neurogenetics.
Neurogenetics studies the role of genetics in the development and function of the nervous system.. It considers neural characteristics as phenotypes (i.e.
Another example is the ROBO3 gene where a mutation alters axon length negatively impacting neuronal connections.. Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) accompanies a mutation here.
QTL mapping can also be carried out in humans, though brain morphologies are examined using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rather than brain slices.. Human beings pose a greater challenge for QTL analysis because the genetic population cannot be as carefully controlled as that of an inbred recombinant population, which can result in sources of statistical error.


=== Recombinant DNA ===
Recombinant DNA is an important method of research in many fields, including neurogenetics.
manifestations, measurable or not, of the genetic make-up of an individual), and is mainly based on the observation that the nervous systems of individuals, even of those belonging to the same species, may not be identical.. As the name implies, it draws aspects from both the studies of neuroscience and genetics, focusing in particular how the genetic code an organism carries affects its expressed traits.
The results of this research can help identify genes that may be associated with conditions involving cognitive and learning deficiencies.


=== Human research ===
Many research facilities seek out volunteers with certain conditions or illnesses to participate in studies.. Model organisms, while important, cannot completely model the complexity of the human body, making volunteers a key part to the progression of research.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.On the other hand, there are a few regions in the mature nervous system, such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, where generation of new neurons can be observed.Glial cells are known to be capable of mitosis.. By contrast, scientific understanding of whether neurons are permanently post-mitotic, or capable of mitosis, is still developing.
"Glia".. The central nervous system: structure and function.
"Quantal transmission: not just for neurons".. Trends in Neurosciences.
Glia, also called glial cells or neuroglia, are non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system.. They maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and provide support and protection for neurons.
Oxford University Press.. p.
In the central nervous system, glial cells include oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglia, and in the peripheral nervous system glial cells include Schwann cells and satellite cells.. They have four main functions: (1) To surround neurons and hold them in place (2) To supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons (3) To insulate one neuron from another (4) To destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons.
Glial cells make up about half the total volume of the brain and spinal cord.. The glia to neuron-ratio varies from one part of the brain to another.
28 (2): 59–62.. doi:10.1016/j.tins.2004.11.010.
doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2008.10.013.. PMID 18995817.
Role of glia in synapse development
Overstreet LS (February 2005).
The glia to neuron-ratio in the cerebral cortex is 3.72 (60.84 billion glia (72%); 16.34 billion neurons), while that of the cerebellum is only 0.23 (16.04 billion glia; 69.03 billion neurons).. The ratio in the cerebral cortex gray matter is 1.48, with 3.76 for the gray and white matter combined.
Glia have a role in the regulation of repair of neurons after injury.. In the central nervous system (CNS), glia suppress repair.
Others regulate the internal environment of the brain, especially the fluid surrounding neurons and their synapses, and nutrify neurons.. During early embryogenesis, glial cells direct the migration of neurons and produce molecules that modify the growth of axons and dendrites.


=== Neuron repair and development ===
Glia are also crucial in the development of the nervous system and in processes such as synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis.
In the peripheral nervous system, glia derive from the neural crest.. These PNS glia include Schwann cells in nerves and satellite glial cells in ganglia.
Current research involving glial cells in the human cochlea proposes that these cells are the common precursor to both mature Schwann cells and satellite glial cells.
After axonal injury, Schwann cells regress to an earlier developmental state to encourage regrowth of the axon.. This difference between the CNS and the PNS, raises hopes for the regeneration of nervous tissue in the CNS.
These dendrocytes resemble an octopus bulbous body and contain up to fifteen arm-like processes.. Each “arm” reaches out to a nerve fiber and spirals around it, creating a myelin sheath.
In the past, glia had been considered to lack certain features of neurons.. For example, glial cells were not believed to have chemical synapses or to release transmitters.
These cells envelop nerve fibers of the PNS by winding repeatedly around a nerve fiber with the nucleus inside of it.. This process creates a myelin sheath, which not only aids in conductivity but also assists in the regeneration of damaged fibers.


=== Myelin sheath creation ===
Oligodendrocytes are another type of glial cell of the CNS.
Additionally, the peripheral glial cells located along the peripheral processes expressed NGFR, indicating a phenotype distinct from the peripheral glial cells located along the central processes.


=== Capacity to divide ===
Glia retain the ability to undergo cell division in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot.. The view is based on the general deficiency of the mature nervous system in replacing neurons after an injury, such as a stroke or trauma, while very often there is a profound proliferation of glia, or gliosis near or at the site of damage.
They are mobile within the brain and multiply when the brain is damaged.. In the healthy central nervous system, microglia processes constantly sample all aspects of their environment (neurons, macroglia and blood vessels).
In a healthy brain, microglia direct the immune response to brain damage and play an important role in the inflammation that accompanies the damage.. Many diseases and disorders are associated with deficient microglia, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ALS.


=== Other ===
Pituicytes from the posterior pituitary are glia cells with characteristics in common to astrocytes.
This myelin sheath insulates the nerve fiber from the extracellular fluid as well as speeds up the signal conduction in the nerve fiber.


=== Neurotransmission ===
Recent research indicates that glial cells of the hippocampus and cerebellum participate in synaptic transmission, regulate the clearance of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft, and release gliotransmitters such as ATP, which modulate synaptic function.Astrocytes are crucial in clearance of neurotransmitters from within the synaptic cleft, which provides distinction between arrival of action potentials and prevents toxic build-up of certain neurotransmitters such as glutamate (excitotoxicity).. It is also thought that glia play a role in many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.
The ratio of the basal ganglia, diencephalon and brainstem combined is 11.35.The total number of glia cells in the human brain is distributed into the different types with oligodendrocytes being the most frequent (45–75%), followed by astrocytes (19–40%) and microglia (about 10% or less).


== Development ==

Most glia are derived from ectodermal tissue of the developing embryo, in particular the neural tube and crest.. The exception is microglia, which are derived from hemopoietic stem cells.
In the adult, microglia are largely a self-renewing population and are distinct from macrophages and monocytes, which infiltrate the injured and diseased CNS.
In the central nervous system, glia develop from the ventricular zone of the neural tube.. These glia include the oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and astrocytes.

Volterra A, Steinhäuser C (August 2004).
They are derived from the earliest wave of mononuclear cells that originate in yolk sac blood islands early in development, and colonize the brain shortly after the neural precursors begin to differentiate.These cells are found in all regions of the brain and spinal cord.. Microglial cells are small relative to macroglial cells, with changing shapes and oblong nuclei.

Then, there is a large amount of microglial activity, which results in inflammation, and finally, there is a heavy release of growth inhibiting molecules.


== History ==
Glia were first described in 1856 by the pathologist Rudolf Virchow in a comment to his 1846 publication on connective tissue.. A more detailed description of glial cells was provided in the 1858 book Cellular Pathology by the same author.When markers for different types of cells were analyzed, Albert Einstein's brain was discovered to contain significantly more glia than normal brains in the left angular gyrus, an area thought to be responsible for mathematical processing and language.The ratio of glia to neurons increases with our definition of intelligence.

Furthermore, at least in vitro, astrocytes can release gliotransmitter glutamate in response to certain stimulation.. Another unique type of glial cell, the oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs, have very well-defined and functional synapses from at least two major groups of neurons.

When severe trauma presents itself, the survival of the remaining neurons becomes the optimal solution.. However, some studies investigating the role of glial cells in Alzheimer's Disease are beginning to contradict the usefulness of this feature, and even claim it can "exacerbate" the disease.
They were considered to be the passive bystanders of neural transmission.. However, recent studies have shown this to be untrue.


== Functions ==
Some glial cells function primarily as the physical support for neurons.
They also play a role in neurotransmission and synaptic connections, and in physiological processes like breathing, .
Glia were discovered in 1856, by the pathologist Rudolf Virchow in his search for a "connective tissue" in the brain.. The term derives from Greek γλία and γλοία "glue"( or ), and suggests the original impression that they were the glue of the nervous system.


== Types ==


=== Macroglia ===
Derived from ectodermal tissue.


=== Microglia ===

Microglia are specialized macrophages capable of phagocytosis that protect neurons of the central nervous system.
In addition to impacting the potential repair of neurons in Alzheimer's Disease, scarring and inflammation from glial cells have been further implicated in the degeneration of neurons caused by Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, a wide range of harmful exposure, such as hypoxia, or physical trauma, can lead to the end result of physical damage to the CNS.. Generally, when damage occurs to the CNS, glial cells cause Apoptosis among the surrounding cellular bodies.
Glial cells known as astrocytes enlarge and proliferate to form a scar and produce inhibitory molecules that inhibit regrowth of a damaged or severed axon.. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), glial cells known as Schwann cells promote repair.
Journal of Neurocytology.. 33 (3): 345–57.
The only notable differences between neurons and glial cells are neurons' possession of axons and dendrites, and capacity to generate action potentials.


== Clinical significance ==

While glial cells in the PNS frequently assist in regeneration of lost neural functioning, loss of neurons in the CNS does not result in a similar reaction from neuroglia.. In the CNS, regrowth will only happen if the trauma was mild, and not severe.

Audio"The Other Brain"—The Leonard Lopate Show (WNYC) "Neuroscientist Douglas Field, explains how glia, which make up approximately 85 percent of the cells in the brain, work.This technique was called pneumoencephalography.
In 1927 Egas Moniz introduced cerebral angiography, whereby both normal and abnormal blood vessels in and around the brain could be visualized with great precision.
In the early 1970s, Allan McLeod Cormack and Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield introduced computerized axial tomography (CAT or CT scanning), and ever more detailed anatomic images of the brain became available for diagnostic and research purposes.. Cormack and Hounsfield won the 1979 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their work.
X-ray images of the ventricular system within the brain were obtained by injection of filtered air directly into one or both lateral ventricles of the brain.. Dandy also observed that air introduced into the subarachnoid space via lumbar spinal puncture could enter the cerebral ventricles and also demonstrate the cerebrospinal fluid compartments around the base of the brain and over its surface.
Physicians who specialize in the performance and interpretation of neuroimaging in the clinical setting are neuroradiologists.
Neuroimaging falls into two broad categories: 

Structural imaging, which deals with the structure of the nervous system and the diagnosis of gross (large scale) intracranial disease (such as a tumor) and injury.
Functional imaging, which is used to diagnose metabolic diseases and lesions on a finer scale (such as Alzheimer's disease) and also for neurological and cognitive psychology research and building brain-computer interfaces.Functional imaging enables, for example, the processing of information by centers in the brain to be visualized directly.. Such processing causes the involved area of the brain to increase metabolism and "light up" on the scan.
A significant limitation of SPECT is its poor resolution (about 1 cm) compared to that of MRI.. Today, SPECT machines with Dual Detector Heads are commonly used, although Triple Detector Head machines are available in the marketplace.
The emission data are computer-processed to produce 2- or 3-dimensional images of the distribution of the chemicals throughout the brain.. The positron emitting radioisotopes used are produced by a cyclotron, and chemicals are labeled with these radioactive atoms.
Advantages include the absence of ionising radiation and the possibility of bedside scanning, but the lack of soft-tissue detail means MRI is preferred for some conditions.


== Advantages and Concerns of Neuroimaging Techniques ==


=== Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) ===
fMRI is commonly classified as a minimally-to-moderate risk due to its non-invasiveness compared to other imaging methods.. fMRI uses blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-contrast in order to produce its form of imaging.
These measurements reflect the amount of brain activity in the various regions of the brain and allow to learn more about how the brain works.. PET scans were superior to all other metabolic imaging methods in terms of resolution and speed of completion (as little as 30 seconds) when they first became available.
The magnetic resonance (MR) emitted from the equipment can cause failure of medical devices and attract metallic objects in the body if not properly screened for.. Currently, the FDA classifies medical implants and devices into three categories, depending on MR-compatibility: MR-safe (safe in all MR environments), MR-unsafe (unsafe in any MR environment), and MR-conditional (MR-compatible in certain environments, requiring further information).FDA MR safety labels for implants and devices
		
		
		


=== Computed Tomography (CT) Scan ===
The CT scan was introduced in the 1970s and quickly became one of the most widely used methods of imaging.
SPECT relies on an injection of radioactive tracer, or "SPECT agent," which is rapidly taken up by the brain but does not redistribute.. Uptake of SPECT agent is nearly 100% complete within 30 to 60 seconds, reflecting cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the time of injection.
Typically the information is presented as cross-sections of the brain.


=== Diffuse optical imaging ===
Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) or diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a medical imaging modality which uses near infrared light to generate images of the body.. The technique measures the optical absorption of haemoglobin, and relies on the absorption spectrum of haemoglobin varying with its oxygenation status.
Neuroimaging or brain imaging is the use of various techniques to either directly or indirectly image the structure, function/pharmacology of the nervous system.. It is a relatively new discipline within medicine, neuroscience, and psychology.
The resolution of fMRI is about 2-3 millimeters at present, limited by the spatial spread of the hemodynamic response to neural activity.. It has largely superseded PET for the study of brain activation patterns.
Patients are injected with radioisotopes that are metabolized in the brain and emit positrons to produce a visualization of brain activity.. The amount of radiation a patient is exposed to in a PET scan is relatively small, comparable to the amount of environmental radiation an individual is exposed to across a year.
These must be made in a cyclotron, and are expensive or even unavailable if necessary transport times are prolonged more than a few half-lives.. SPECT, however, is able to make use of tracers with much longer half-lives, such as technetium-99m, and as a result, is far more widely available.


=== Cranial ultrasound ===
Cranial ultrasound is usually only used in babies, whose open fontanelles provide acoustic windows allowing ultrasound imaging of the brain.
One of the more controversial uses of neuroimaging has been researching "thought identification" or mind-reading.


== History ==

The first chapter of the history of neuroimaging traces back to the Italian neuroscientist Angelo Mosso who invented the 'human circulation balance', which could non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity.. However, even if only briefly mentioned by William James in 1890, the details and precise workings of this balance and the experiments Mosso performed with it have remained largely unknown until the recent discovery of the original instrument as well as Mosso’s reports by Stefano Sandrone and colleagues.In 1918 the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy introduced the technique of ventriculography.
Soon after the introduction of CAT in the early 1980s, the development of radioligands allowed single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain.
More or less concurrently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI or MR scanning) was developed by researchers including Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur, who were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2003.. In the early 1980s MRI was introduced clinically, and during the 1980s a veritable explosion of technical refinements and diagnostic MR applications took place.
CT scans can expose patients to levels of radiation 100-500 times higher than traditional x-rays, with higher radiation doses producing better resolution imaging.. While easy to use, increases in CT scan use, especially in asymptomatic patients, is a topic of concern since patients are exposed to significantly high levels of radiation.


=== Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ===
In PET scans, imaging does not rely on intrinsic biological processes, but relies on a foreign substance injected into the bloodstream traveling to the brain.
Whereas techniques such as diffuse optical imaging (DOT) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measure optical absorption of haemoglobin, and thus are based on blood flow, EROS takes advantage of the scattering properties of the neurons themselves and thus provides a much more direct measure of cellular activity.. EROS can pinpoint activity in the brain within millimeters (spatially) and within milliseconds (temporally).
The improved resolution permitted better study to be made as to the area of the brain activated by a particular task.. The biggest drawback of PET scanning is that because the radioactivity decays rapidly, it is limited to monitoring short tasks.
Many functions also involve multiple parts of the brain, meaning that this type of claim is probably both unverifiable with the equipment used, and generally based on an incorrect assumption about how brain functions are divided.. It may be that most brain functions will only be described correctly after being measured with much more fine-grained measurements that look not at large regions but instead at a very large number of tiny individual brain circuits.
High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) has been compared directly to fMRI using response to visual stimulation in subjects studied with both techniques, with reassuringly similar results.. HD-DOT has also been compared to fMRI in terms of language tasks and resting state functional connectivity.


=== Event-related optical signal ===
Event-related optical signal (EROS) is a brain-scanning technique which uses infrared light through optical fibers to measure changes in optical properties of active areas of the cerebral cortex.
Studies indicate that presence of migraine does not increase a patient's risk for intracranial disease.. A diagnosis of migraine which notes the absence of other problems, such as papilledema, would not indicate a need for neuroimaging.
PET, however, retains the significant advantage of being able to identify specific brain receptors (or transporters) associated with particular neurotransmitters through its ability to image radiolabelled receptor "ligands" (receptor ligands are any chemicals that stick to receptors).
As well as research on healthy subjects, fMRI is increasingly used for the medical diagnosis of disease.. Because fMRI is exquisitely sensitive to oxygen usage in blood flow, it is extremely sensitive to early changes in the brain resulting from ischemia (abnormally low blood flow), such as the changes which follow stroke.
Both MEG and EEG do not require exposure of the patient to radiation to function.. EEG electrodes detect electrical signals produced by neurons to measure brain activity and MEG uses oscillations in the magnetic field produced by these electrical currents to measure activity.
According to the oxygenation hypothesis, changes in oxygen usage in regional cerebral blood flow during cognitive or behavioral activity can be associated with the regional neurons as being directly related to the cognitive or behavioral tasks being attended.
Most fMRI scanners allow subjects to be presented with different visual images, sounds and touch stimuli, and to make different actions such as pressing a button or moving a joystick.. Consequently, fMRI can be used to reveal brain structures and processes associated with perception, thought and action.
Before fMRI technology came online, PET scanning was the preferred method of functional (as opposed to structural) brain imaging, and it continues to make large contributions to neuroscience.
PET scanning is also used for diagnosis of brain disease, most notably because brain tumors, strokes, and neuron-damaging diseases which cause dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) all cause great changes in brain metabolism, which in turn causes easily detectable changes in PET scans.. PET is probably most useful in early cases of certain dementias (with classic examples being Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease) where the early damage is too diffuse and makes too little difference in brain volume and gross structure to change CT and standard MRI images enough to be able to reliably differentiate it from the "normal" range of cortical atrophy which occurs with aging (in many but not all) persons, and which does not cause clinical dementia.


=== Single-photon emission computed tomography ===
Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is similar to PET and uses gamma ray-emitting radioisotopes and a gamma camera to record data that a computer uses to construct two- or three-dimensional images of active brain regions.
PET radioisotopes have limited exposure time in the body as they commonly have very short half-lives (~2 hours) and decay rapidly.. Currently, fMRI is a preferred method of imaging brain activity compared to PET, since it does not involve radiation, has a higher temporal resolution than PET, and is more readily available in most medical settings.


=== Magnetoencephalography (MEG) & Electroencephalography (EEG) ===
The high temporal resolution of MEG and EEG allow these methods to measure brain activity down to the millisecond.
The main application area is crude forms of brain-computer interface.


== Indications ==
Neuroimaging follows a neurological examination in which a physician has found cause to more deeply investigate a patient who has or may have a neurological disorder.
One of the more common neurological problems which a person may experience is simple syncope.. In cases of simple syncope in which the patient's history does not suggest other neurological symptoms, the diagnosis includes a neurological examination but routine neurological imaging is not indicated because the likelihood of finding a cause in the central nervous system is extremely low and the patient is unlikely to benefit from the procedure.Neuroimaging is not indicated for patients with stable headaches which are diagnosed as migraine.
The labeled compound, called a radiotracer, is injected into the bloodstream and eventually makes its way to the brain.. Sensors in the PET scanner detect the radioactivity as the compound accumulates in various regions of the brain.
Early diagnosis of certain types of stroke is increasingly important in neurology, since substances which dissolve blood clots may be used in the first few hours after certain types of stroke occur, but are dangerous to use afterward.. Brain changes seen on fMRI may help to make the decision to treat with these agents.
Real heads are non-spherical and have largely anisotropic conductivities (particularly white matter and skull).. While skull anisotropy has a negligible effect on MEG (unlike EEG), white matter anisotropy strongly affects MEG measurements for radial and deep sources.
Note, however, that the skull was assumed to be uniformly anisotropic in this study, which is not true for a real head: the absolute and relative thicknesses of diploë and tables layers vary among and within the skull bones.. This makes it likely that MEG is also affected by the skull anisotropy, although probably not to the same degree as EEG.
There are many uses for MEG, including assisting surgeons in localizing a pathology, assisting researchers in determining the function of various parts of the brain, neurofeedback, and others.


=== Positron emission tomography ===
Positron emission tomography (PET) and brain positron emission tomography, measure emissions from radioactively labeled metabolically active chemicals that have been injected into the bloodstream.
A computer uses the data gathered by the sensors to create multicolored 2- or 3-dimensional images that show where the compound acts in the brain.. Especially useful are a wide array of ligands used to map different aspects of neurotransmitter activity, with by far the most commonly used PET tracer being a labeled form of glucose (see Fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG)).
The greatest benefit of PET scanning is that different compounds can show blood flow and oxygen and glucose metabolism in the tissues of the working brain.
A barrier in the widespread usage of MEG is due to pricing, as MEG systems can cost millions of dollars.. EEG is a much more widely used method to achieve such temporal resolution as EEG systems cost much less than MEG systems.
In the course of conducting a careful diagnosis, the physician should consider whether the headache has a cause other than the migraine and might require neuroimaging.Another indication for neuroimaging is CT-, MRI- and PET-guided stereotactic surgery or radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.


== Brain imaging techniques ==


=== Computed axial tomography ===

Computed tomography (CT) or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scanning uses a series of x-rays of the head taken from many different directions.. Typically used for quickly viewing brain injuries, CT scanning uses a computer program that performs a numerical integral calculation (the inverse Radon transform) on the measured x-ray series to estimate how much of an x-ray beam is absorbed in a small volume of the brain.

=== Magnetic resonance imaging ===
 

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce high quality two- or three-dimensional images of brain structures without the use of ionizing radiation (X-rays) or radioactive tracers.


=== Functional magnetic resonance imaging ===

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) relies on the paramagnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to see images of changing blood flow in the brain associated with neural activity.. This allows images to be generated that reflect which brain structures are activated (and how) during the performance of different tasks or at resting state.
Its biggest downside is the inability to detect activity more than a few centimeters deep.. EROS is a new, relatively inexpensive technique that is non-invasive to the test subject.
BOLD-contrast is a naturally occurring process in the body so fMRI is often preferred over imaging methods that require radioactive markers to produce similar imaging.. A concern in the use of fMRI is its use in individuals with medical implants or devices and metallic items in the body.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace..

They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.

They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Autism, Tourette's syndrome and some cases of obsessive compulsive disorder as well as the neurobehavioral associated symptoms of degeneratives of the nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and organic psychosis.)Many of the diseases and disorders listed above have neurosurgical treatments available (e.g..

In general, numerous fields intersect to try and understand the basic processes involved in mental functioning, many of which are brought together in cognitive science.

== Mental functioning ==
A neurological examination can, to some extent, assess the impact of neurological damage and disease on brain function in terms of behavior, memory or cognition.. Behavioral neurology specializes in this area.
In practice, cases may present as one type but be assessed as more appropriate to the other.. Neuropsychiatry deals with mental disorders arising from specific identified diseases of the nervous system.
One area that can be contested is in cases of idiopathic neurological symptoms - conditions where the cause cannot be established.
A neurological disorder is any disorder of the nervous system.. Structural, biochemical or electrical abnormalities in the brain, spinal cord or other nerves can result in a range of symptoms.
It can be decided in some cases, perhaps by exclusion of any accepted diagnosis, that higher-level brain/mental activity is causing symptoms, rather than the symptoms originating in the area of the nervous system from which they may appear to originate.. Classic examples are "functional" seizures, sensory numbness, "functional" limb weakness and functional neurological deficit ("functional" in this context is usually contrasted with the old term "organic disease").
They may be assessed by neurological examination, and studied and treated within the specialities of neurology and clinical neuropsychology.
Interventions for neurological disorders include preventative measures, lifestyle changes, physiotherapy or other therapy, neurorehabilitation, pain management, medication, or operations performed by neurosurgeons.. The World Health Organization estimated in 2006 that neurological disorders and their sequelae (direct consequences) affect as many as one billion people worldwide, and identified health inequalities and social stigma/discrimination as major factors contributing to the associated disability and suffering.


== Causes ==
 Although the brain and spinal cord are surrounded by tough membranes, enclosed in the bones of the skull and spinal vertebrae, and chemically isolated by the blood–brain barrier, they are very susceptible if compromised.
For example, cerebrovascular disorders involve brain injury due to problems with the blood vessels (cardiovascular system) supplying the brain; autoimmune disorders involve damage caused by the body's own immune system; lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann-Pick disease can lead to neurological deterioration.. The National Institutes of Health recommend considering the evaluation of an underlying celiac disease in people with unexplained neurological symptoms, particularly peripheral neuropathy or ataxia.In a substantial minority of cases of neurological symptoms, no neural cause can be identified using current testing procedures, and such "idiopathic" conditions can invite different theories about what is occurring.


== Classification ==

Neurological disorders can be categorized according to the primary location affected, the primary type of dysfunction involved, or the primary type of cause.
In addition, clinical neuropsychology uses neuropsychological assessment to precisely identify and track problems in mental functioning, usually after some sort of brain injury or neurological impairment.
Alternatively, a condition might first be detected through the presence of abnormalities in mental functioning, and further assessment may indicate an underlying neurological disorder.. There are sometimes unclear boundaries in the distinction between disorders treated within neurology, and mental disorders treated within the other medical specialty of psychiatry, or other mental health professions such as clinical psychology.
Such cases may be contentiously interpreted as being "psychological" rather than "neurological".. Some cases may be classified as mental disorders, for example as conversion disorder, if the symptoms appear to be causally linked to emotional states or responses to social stress or social contexts.
On the other hand, dissociation refers to partial or complete disruption of the integration of a person's conscious functioning, such that a person may feel detached from one's emotions, body and/or immediate surroundings.
In clinical practice, mental disorders are usually indicated by a mental state examination, or other type of structured interview or questionnaire process.. At the present time, neuroimaging (brain scans) alone cannot accurately diagnose a mental disorder or tell the risk of developing one; however, it can be used to rule out other medical conditions such as a brain tumor.
The distinction between neurological and mental disorders can be a matter of some debate, either in regard to specific facts about the cause of a condition or in regard to the general understanding of brain and mind.
Moveover, the definition of disorder in medicine or psychology is sometimes contested in terms of what is considered abnormal, dysfunctional, harmful or unnatural in neurological, evolutionary,  psychometric or social terms.

Nerves tend to lie deep under the skin but can still become exposed to damage.. Individual neurons, and the neural networks and nerves into which they form, are susceptible to electrochemical and structural disruption.
Neuroregeneration may occur in the peripheral nervous system and thus overcome or work around injuries to some extents, but it is thought to be rare in the brain and spinal cord.
The specific causes of neurological problems vary, but can include genetic disorders, congenital abnormalities or disorders, infections, lifestyle or environmental health problems including malnutrition, and brain injury, spinal cord injury or nerve injury.. The problem may start in another body system that interacts with the nervous system.
Examples of symptoms include paralysis, muscle weakness, poor coordination, loss of sensation, seizures, confusion, pain and altered levels of consciousness.. There are many recognized neurological disorders, some relatively common, but many rare.Neurology (from Greek: νεῦρον (neûron), "string, nerve" and the suffix -logia, "study of") is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system.. Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous systems (and their subdivisions, the autonomic and  somatic nervous systems), including their coverings, blood vessels, and all effector tissue, such as muscle.
US and Germany, neurologists may subspecialize in clinical neurophysiology, the field responsible for EEG and intraoperative monitoring, or in electrodiagnostic medicine nerve conduction studies, EMG,and evoked potentials.. In other countries, this is an autonomous specialty (e.g., United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain).


=== Overlap with psychiatry ===

Although mental illnesses are believed by many to be neurological disorders affecting the central nervous system, traditionally they are classified separately, and treated by psychiatrists.
Commonly employed tests in neurology include imaging studies such as computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound of major blood vessels of the head and neck.. Neurophysiologic studies, including electroencephalography (EEG), needle electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and evoked potentials are also commonly ordered.
Neurosurgery is a distinct specialty that involves a different training path, and emphasizes the surgical treatment of neurological disorders.
Also, many nonmedical doctors, those with doctoral degrees(usually PhDs) in subjects such as biology and chemistry, study and research the nervous system.. Working in laboratories in universities, hospitals, and private companies, these neuroscientists perform clinical and laboratory experiments and tests to learn more about the nervous system and find cures or new treatments for diseases and disorders.
A great deal of overlap occurs between neuroscience and neurology.
A period of research is essential, and obtaining a higher degree aids career progression.. Many found it was eased after an attachment to the Institute of Neurology at Queen Square, London.
Lumbar punctures are frequently performed by neurologists.. Some neurologists may develop an interest in particular subfields, such as stroke, dementia, movement disorders, neurointensive care, headaches, epilepsy, sleep disorders, chronic pain management, multiple sclerosis, or neuromuscular diseases.


=== Overlapping areas ===
Some overlap also occurs with other specialties, varying from country to country and even within a local geographic area.
Acute head trauma is most often treated by neurosurgeons, whereas sequelae of head trauma may be treated by neurologists or specialists in rehabilitation medicine.. Although stroke cases have been traditionally managed by internal medicine or hospitalists, the emergence of vascular neurology and interventional neuroradiology has created a demand for stroke specialists.
Typically, the exam tests mental status, function of the cranial nerves (including vision), strength, coordination, reflexes, and sensation.. This information helps the neurologist determine whether the problem exists in the nervous system and the clinical localization.
Subspecialties include brain injury medicine, clinical neurophysiology, epilepsy, hospice and palliative medicine, neurodevelopmental disabilities, neuromuscular medicine, pain medicine, sleep medicine, neurocritical care, vascular neurology (stroke), behavioral neurology, child neurology, headache, multiple sclerosis, neuroimaging, neurorehabilitation.
In Germany, a compulsory year of psychiatry must be done to complete a residency of neurology.
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, neurology is a subspecialty of general (internal) medicine.. After five to nine years of medical school and a year as a preregistration house officer (or two years on the Foundation Programme), a neurologist must pass the examination for Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (or the Irish equivalent) before completing two years of core medical training and then entering specialist training in neurology.
A generation ago, some neurologists would have also spent a couple of years working in psychiatric units and obtain a diploma in psychological medicine.. However, this requirement has become uncommon, and, now that a basic psychiatric qualification takes three years to obtain, the requirement is no longer practical.
And the fact that the brain and mind are one makes the separation artificial anyway".Neurological disorders often have psychiatric manifestations, such as poststroke depression, depression and dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, mood and cognitive dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington disease, to name a few.. Hence, the sharp distinction between neurology and psychiatry is not always on a biological basis.
They can include referring the patient to a physiotherapist, prescribing medications, or recommending a surgical procedure.
Some neurologists specialize in certain parts of the nervous system or in specific procedures.. For example, clinical neurophysiologists specialize in the use of EEG and intraoperative monitoring to diagnose certain neurological disorders.
The four-year residency consists of one year of internal medicine internship training followed by three years of training in neurology.
Some neurologists receive additional subspecialty training focusing on a particular area of the field.. These training programs are called fellowships, and are one to two years in duration.
The dominance of psychoanalytic theory in the first three-quarters of the 20th century has since then been largely replaced by a focus on pharmacology.. Despite the shift to a medical model, brain science has not advanced to the point where scientists or clinicians can point to readily discernible pathologic lesions or genetic abnormalities that in and of themselves serve as reliable or predictive biomarkers of a given mental disorder.


== Neurological enhancement ==
The emerging field of neurological enhancement highlights the potential of therapies to improve such things as workplace efficacy, attention in school, and overall happiness in personal lives.
Neurological practice relies heavily on the field of neuroscience, which is the scientific study of the nervous system.
A neurologist is a physician specializing in neurology and trained to investigate, or diagnose and treat neurological disorders.. Neurologists may also be involved in clinical research, clinical trials, and basic or translational research.
The American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine certifies US physicians in electrodiagnostic medicine and certifies technologists in nerve-conduction studies.. Sleep medicine is a subspecialty field in the US under several medical specialties including anesthesiology, internal medicine, family medicine, and neurology.
However, this field has also given rise to questions about neuroethics and the psychopharmacology of lifestyle drugs.

== Training ==
 Many neurologists also have additional training or interest in one area of neurology, such as stroke, epilepsy, neuromuscular, sleep medicine, pain management, or movement disorders.
In the United States and Canada, neurologists are physicians having completed postgraduate training in neurology after graduation from medical school.. Neurologists complete, on average, about 8 years of medical college education and clinical training, which includes obtaining a four-year undergraduate degree, a medical degree (DO or MD), which comprises an additional four years of study, then completing one year of basic clinical training and four years of residency.
Physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians also in the US diagnosis and treat patients with neuromuscular diseases through the use of electrodiagnostic studies (needle EMG and nerve-conduction studies) and other diagnostic tools.. In the United Kingdom and other countries, many of the conditions encountered by older patients such as movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, stroke, dementia, or gait disorders, are managed predominantly by specialists in geriatric medicine.
Clinical neuropsychologists are often called upon to evaluate brain-behavior relationships for the purpose of assisting with differential diagnosis, planning rehabilitation strategies, documenting cognitive strengths and weaknesses, and measuring change over time (e.g., for identifying abnormal aging or tracking the progression of a dementia).


=== Relationship to clinical neurophysiology ===
In some countries, e.g.
In a 2002 review article in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Professor Joseph B.. Martin, Dean of Harvard Medical School and a neurologist by training, wrote, "the separation of the two categories is arbitrary, often influenced by beliefs rather than proven scientific observations.
Neurologists frequently perform lumbar punctures to assess characteristics of a patient's cerebrospinal fluid.. Advances in genetic testing have made genetic testing an important tool in the classification of inherited neuromuscular disease and diagnosis of many other neurogenetic diseases.
Some neurologists enter the field of rehabilitation medicine (known as physiatry in the US) to specialise in neurological rehabilitation, which may include stroke medicine, as well as brain injuries.


== Physical examination ==

During a neurological examination, the neurologist reviews the patient's health history with special attention to the current condition.. The patient then takes a neurological exam.
Many neurologists work in academic training hospitals, where they conduct research as neuroscientists in addition to treating patients and teaching neurology to medical students.


=== General caseload ===
Neurologists are responsible for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of all the conditions mentioned above.. When surgical or endovascular intervention is required, the neurologist may refer the patient to a neurosurgeon or an interventional neuroradiologist.
The role of genetic influences on the development of acquired neurologic diseases is an active area of research.
Some of the commonly encountered conditions treated by neurologists include headaches, radiculopathy, neuropathy, stroke, dementia, seizures and epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, head trauma, sleep disorders, neuromuscular diseases, and various infections and tumors of the nervous system.. Neurologists are also asked to evaluate unresponsive patients on life support to confirm brain death.
Treatment options vary depending on the neurological problem.
Neurologists begin their interactions with patients by taking a comprehensive medical history, and then performing a physical examination focusing on evaluating the nervous system.. Components of the neurological examination include assessment of the patient's cognitive function, cranial nerves, motor strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait.
In some instances, neurologists may order additional diagnostic tests as part of the evaluation.
Sleep disorders are also treated by pulmonologists and psychiatrists.. Cerebral palsy is initially treated by pediatricians, but care may be transferred to an adult neurologist after the patient reaches a certain age.
While neurology is a nonsurgical specialty, its corresponding surgical specialty is neurosurgery.Significant overlap occurs between the fields of neurology and psychiatry, with the boundary between the two disciplines and the conditions they treat being somewhat nebulous.


== Scope ==

A large number of neurological disorders have been described as listed.. These can affect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), the peripheral nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, and the muscular system.


== History ==

The academic discipline began between the 16th and 19th centuries with the work and research of many neurologists such as Thomas Willis, Robert Whytt, Matthew Baillie, Charles Bell, Moritz Heinrich Romberg, Duchenne de Boulogne, William A.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another.. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: for example, neurons can lack dendrites, or have no axon, and synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.
All neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium.
In a human, there are an estimated 10–20 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 55–70 billion neurons in the cerebellum.. By contrast, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just 302 neurons, making it an ideal model organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons.
Sensory neurons respond to one particular type of stimulus such as touch, sound, or light and all other stimuli affecting the cells of the sensory organs, and converts it into an electrical signal via transduction, which is then sent to the spinal cord or brain.. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output.
In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely.. Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing.
By inserting electrodes into the giant squid axons, accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential.
The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential).. These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl−), and calcium (Ca2+).
There are several stimuli that can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including pressure, stretch, chemical transmitters, and changes of the electric potential across the cell membrane.
Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.


==== Discharge patterns ====
Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory patterns.. So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics:

Tonic or regular spiking.
Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine.. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
Dendrites typically branch profusely, getting thinner with each branching, and extending their farthest branches a few hundred micrometers from the soma.. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock, and can extend for great distances, giving rise to hundreds of branches.
The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century.. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.
Later discoveries yielded a few refinements to the simplest form of the doctrine.
It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 1015 synapses (1 quadrillion).. This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood.
Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.. However, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.


== Overview ==

A neuron is a specialized type of cell found in the bodies of all animals except sponges, and a few other simpler animals.
For example, glial cells, which are not considered neurons, play an essential role in information processing.. Also, electrical synapses are more common than previously thought, meaning that there are direct, cytoplasmic connections between neurons.
There are no neurons that lack a soma, but there are neurons that lack dendrites, and others that lack an axon.. Furthermore, in addition to the typical axodendritic and axosomatic synapses, there are axoaxonic (axon-to-axon) and dendrodendritic (dendrite-to-dendrite) synapses.
The key to neural function is the synaptic signaling process, which is partly electrical and partly chemical.
Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called tracts.. The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates.
If the pressure is steady, there is no more stimulus; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again.. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons.


== History ==

The neuron's place as the primary functional unit of the nervous system was first recognized in the late 19th century through the work of the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal.To make the structure of individual neurons visible, Ramón y Cajal improved a silver staining process that had been developed by Camillo Golgi.
Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeters thick, several centimeters long).
Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see neurogenesis).


=== Histology and internal structure ===

Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies (or Nissl substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic ("base-loving") dye.. These structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA.
A report in Nature suggested that researchers had found a way to transform human skin cells into working nerve cells using a process called transdifferentiation in which "cells are forced to adopt new identities".


== Nerve regeneration ==

It is often possible for peripheral axons to regrow if they are severed, but a neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás' law).

Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft.. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.
The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by the myelin sheath.. Around the cell body is a branching dendritic tree that receives signals from other neurons.
Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and send out signals down the axon.. Numerous axons are often bundled into fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire make up cables).

IBRO (International Brain Research Organization).
A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active.. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that actively transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other.
Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury.. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate.
The features that define a neuron are electrical excitability and the presence of synapses, which are complex membrane junctions that transmit signals to other cells.. The body's neurons, plus the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support, together constitute the nervous system.
Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age.. Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules.
The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy.. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1 mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels.
The end of the axon has branching terminals (axon terminal) that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.


=== Structural classification ===


==== Polarity ====

Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as:

Unipolar: only 1 process
Bipolar: 1 axon and 1 dendrite
Multipolar: 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites
Golgi I: neurons with long-projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells.
Golgi II: neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule cell.
Anaxonic: where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s).
pseudounipolar: 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite


==== Other ====
Furthermore, some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape.. Some examples are:

Basket cells, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and cerebellum.
Betz cells, large motor neurons.
Lugaro cells, interneurons of the cerebellum.
Medium spiny neurons, most neurons in the corpus striatum.
Purkinje cells, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron.
Pyramidal cells, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I.
Renshaw cells, neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons.
Unipolar brush cells, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft.
Granule cells, a type of Golgi II neuron.
Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord.
Spindle cells, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain


=== Functional classification ===


==== Direction ====
Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called sensory neurons.
Efferent neurons transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells and are also called motor neurons.
Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send information from the brain.


==== Action on other neurons ====
A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors.
Later studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells, and a vast majority of neurons composing the neocortex were formed before birth and persist without replacement.. The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans, and its contribution to cognition are still controversial with several conflicting reports being published in 2018.The body contains a variety of stem cell types that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons.
To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons.. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system.
Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels.. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative action potential threshold.
Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre and post synaptic neurotransmission.. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson's disease.
Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.
Some neurons do not generate action potentials, but instead generate a graded electrical signal, which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release.. Such non-spiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances.


== Neural coding ==
Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons.
NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.
Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability.Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, resulting in brain damage.. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons causing NMDA and AMPA receptor activation more so than would normally be the case outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage.
GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase.
Glutamatergic neurons—glutamate.. Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, the other being Aspartate.
This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine.
The axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length.. The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it).
Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells.. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock.
As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as Parkinson disease, is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech.. Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders.
Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine.. Tyrosine is catalyzed into levadopa (or L-DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxlase, and levadopa is then converted into dopamine by amino acid decarboxylase.
Serotonergic neurons—serotonin.
Presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, with 36 in 100,000 affected.Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known simply as Alzheimer's, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes.. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories.
The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.
The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches.. This overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree.
Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord in neural networks.
A typical neuron consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon.. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly in its undifferentiated stage.

Typical axons almost never contain ribosomes, except some in the initial segment.. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases.


== Classification ==

Neurons exist in a number of different shapes and sizes and can be classified by their morphology and function.
Once fully differentiated neurons are formed, they are no longer capable of undergoing mitosis.. Neurogenesis primarily occurs in the embryo of most organisms.
It has been demonstrated that neurogenesis can sometimes occur in the adult vertebrate brain, a finding that led to controversy in 1999.
Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic.
Fast spiking.. Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates, for example some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons, cells in globus pallidus, retinal ganglion cells.


==== Classification by neurotransmitter production ====
Cholinergic neurons—acetylcholine.
Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems.. PD is both chronic and progressive.
Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities.
In fact, there are examples of neurons forming even tighter coupling: the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons.Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization, which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one direction: away from the cell body.. The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons and axons can receive synaptic inputs.


== Neurons in the brain ==
The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species.
Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl (1860–1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active.. Basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) haematoxylin  highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA.
The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which together with neurotubules (neuronal microtubules) are assembled into larger neurofibrils.
Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A.
GABAergic neurons—gamma aminobutyric acid.. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the central nervous system (CNS), the other being Glycine.
The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses, and the relationships amongst the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble.. It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information.


== All-or-none principle ==
The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all-or-none response.
Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase.Dopaminergic neurons—dopamine.. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA.
The improved process involves a technique called "double impregnation" and is still in use today.
In 1888 Ramón y Cajal published a paper about the bird cerebellum.. In this paper, he tells he could not find evidence for anastomis between axons and dendrites and calls each nervous element "an absolutely autonomous canton." This became known as the neuron doctrine, one of the central tenets of modern neuroscience.In 1891 the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review about the neuron doctrine in which he introduced the term neuron to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the nervous system.The silver impregnation stains are an extremely useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because, for reasons unknown, it stains a very small percentage of cells in a tissue, so one is able to see the complete micro structure of individual neurons without much overlap from other cells in the densely packed brain.


=== Neuron doctrine ===
The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system.
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors.. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems.


== Neurological disorders ==

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease.
High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal also triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.An autapse is a synapse in which a neuron's axon connects to its own dendrites.
The human brain has a huge number of synapses.. Each of the 1011 (one hundred billion) neurons has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons.
This is also known as a wave of depolarization.


== Anatomy and histology ==

Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals.. Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties.
Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development.. There the actin dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule.There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites.
The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.
Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults.. Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks.
There are different types of receptor responses to stimuli, slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing.. These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second.
Stimuli cause specific ion-channels within the cell membrane to open, leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane, changing the membrane potential.. Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron type.Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly.
Similarly, GABA acts on several different types of receptors, but all of them have effects (in adult animals, at least) that are inhibitory.. Because of this consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to simplify the terminology by referring to cells that release glutamate as "excitatory neurons", and cells that release GABA as "inhibitory neurons".
Unlike dendrites, an axon usually maintains the same diameter as it extends.. The soma may give rise to numerous dendrites, but never to more than one axon.
Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions.. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane.
Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 1014 to 5 x 1014 synapses (100 to 500 trillion).


== Mechanisms for propagating action potentials ==
In 1937, John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties.. Being larger than but similar in nature to human neurons, squid cells were easier to study.
Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, and then further by aromatic acid decarboxylase.. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression.
In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea.
A typical neuron is divided into three parts: the soma or cell body, dendrites, and axon.. The soma is usually compact; the axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it.
The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter, but by the type of receptor that is activated.. A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same type of key can here be used to open many different types of locks.
Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory.. If the net excitation received by a neuron over a short period of time is large enough, the neuron generates a brief pulse called an action potential, which originates at the soma and propagates rapidly along the axon, activating synapses onto other neurons as it goes.
Many neurons fit the foregoing schema in every respect, but there are also exceptions to most parts of it.
Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).AMPA and Kainate receptors both function as cation channels permeable to Na+ cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission
NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca2+.. The function of NMDA receptors is dependant on Glycine receptor binding as a co-agonist within the channel pore.
While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.
The axon terminal contains synapses, specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons.The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.
Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker.. The soma is usually about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains.
Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory and either increase or decrease activity in the target neuron, respectively.. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically conductive junctions between cells.In a chemical synapse, the process of synaptic transmission is as follows: when an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal.
GABA has a homologous function to ACh, gating anion channels that allow Cl− ions to enter the post synaptic neuron.. Cl− causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative (recall that for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached).
Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels.. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated and this change in cross-membrane potential travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives.
In most cases, neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood.
The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites.. Type I cells can be further divided by where the cell body or soma is located.

Ramón y Cajal, S.
Neurons can connect to each other to form neural pathways, and neural circuits.. Neurons are the primary components of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and of the peripheral nervous system, which comprises the autonomic nervous system and the somatic nervous system.
There are many types of specialized neurons.
Neurons in the adult brain generally do not undergo cell division.. Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells that have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency.
Rather, it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron.. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still.
It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia).. The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain.
Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft.. It acts as a ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors.
The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process.. Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation.
Since over 90% of the neurons in the brain release either glutamate or GABA, these labels encompass the great majority of neurons.. There are also other types of neurons that have consistent effects on their targets, for example, "excitatory" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine, and "inhibitory" spinal neurons that release glycine.
The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute, however.
Some neurons are typically constantly (or tonically) active, typically firing at a constant frequency.. Example: interneurons in neurostriatum.
Phasic or bursting.In 1811, Julien Jean César Legallois studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the medulla oblongata.. In the same year, Charles Bell finished work on what would later become known as the Bell-Magendie law, which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal cord.
Magendie studied and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum’s role in equilibration to complete the Bell-Magendie law.. In 1838, Theodor Schwann began studying white and grey matter in the brain, and discovered the myelin sheath.

In 1760, Arne-Charles studied how different lesions in the cerebellum could affect motor movements.. In 1776, Vincenzo Malacarne studied the cerebellum intensely, and published a book solely based on its function and appearance.
In 1784, Félix Vicq-d'Azyr, discovered a black colored structure in the midbrain.
Neurophysiology (from Greek νεῦρον, neuron, "nerve"; φύσις, physis, "nature, origin"; and -λογία, -logia, "knowledge") is a branch of physiology and neuroscience that is concerned with the study of the functioning of the nervous system.. The primary tools of basic neurophysiological research include electrophysiological recordings, such as patch clamp, voltage clamp, extracellular single-unit recording and recording of local field potentials, as well as some of the methods of calcium imaging, optogenetics, and molecular biology.
Neurophysiology is related to electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, psychology and mathematical neuroscience.

Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.Kandel; James H.. Schwartz; Thomas M.
For instance, the olfactory glomeruli function as sorts of way-stations for the information flowing from the olfactory receptor neurons to the olfactory cortex.. The inner plexiform layer of the retina is a little more complex.

Comparing the concentrations can determine whether or not proportions of different postsynaptic elements contacted a particular axonal pathway.. Relative concentrations could signify a reflection of different postsynaptic elements in the neuropil or show that axons sought out and formed synapses only with specific postsynaptic elements.


== Function ==
Since neuropils have a diverse role in the nervous system, it is difficult to define a certain overarching function for all neuropils.
In chimpanzees these prefrontal regions did not display significantly more neuropil.


=== Arthropods ===
The optic lobe of arthropods and the ganglia of the arthropod brain as well as the ganglia in the ventral nerve cord are unmyelinated and therefore belong to the class of neuropils.


== Research ==
Research has focused on where neuropil is found in many different species in order to unveil the range of significance it has and possible functions.


=== Recent studies ===
In chimpanzees and humans the neuropil provides a proxy measure of total connectivity within a local region because it is composed mostly of dendrites, axons, and synapses.In insects the central complex plays an important role in higher-order brain function.. The neuropil in Drosophila Ellipsoid is composed of four substructures.
However, the degree of similarity depends upon the composition of neuropil being compared.. The concentrations of neuropil within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence.

Researchers have tied the disease to a decrease in the expression of drebrin, a protein thought to play a role in long-term potentiation, meaning the neurons would lose plasticity and have trouble forming new connections.. This malfunction presents itself in the form of helical filaments that tangle together in the neuropil.
To have an optimized neural system it must balance four variables — it must "minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of 'wire' used to construct circuits" as well as "maximize the density of synapses", essentially optimizing the neuropil.. Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory formulated the optimal balance of the four variables and calculated the optimal ratio of axon plus dendrite volume (i.e.

These observations suggest that the central complex not only plays a role in locomotor behavior, but fine tuning as well.. There is also additional evidence that the neuropil may function in olfactory associative learning and memory.In humans, schizophrenia may be caused by deterioration of neuropil, with much evidence specifically pointing to dysfunction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

The bipolar cells post-synaptic to either rods or cones are either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on whether the bipolar cells have sign-inverting synapses or a sign-conserving synapses.


=== Efficiency in the brain ===
Neurons are necessary for all connections made in the brain, and thus can be thought of as the "wires" of the brain.. As in computing, an entity is most efficient when its wires are optimized; therefore, a brain which has undergone millions of years of natural selection would be expected to have optimized neural circuitry.
Research has shown reduced neuropil in area 9 of schizophrenics, as well as consistent findings of reduced spine density in layer III pyramidal neurons of the temporal and frontal cortices.. Since neuropil is the location of most cortical synapses it is likely that the deterioration greatly affects processing and produces the symptoms schizophrenics exhibit.

Neuropil has been found in the following regions: outer neocortex layer, barrel cortex, inner plexiform layer and outer plexiform layer, posterior pituitary, and glomeruli of the cerebellum.. These are all found in humans, with the exception of the barrel cortex, but many species have counterparts similar to our own regions of neuropil.

Each section has been observed in several insects as well as the influence it has on behavior, however the exact function of this neuropil has proven elusive.. Abnormal walking behavior and flight behavior are controlled primarily by the central complex and genetic mutations that disrupt the structure support the hypothesis that the central complex neuropil is a site of behavioral control.Michael Merzenich, Jon Kaas and Doug Rasmusson were some of those researchers.. They found that if the cortical map is deprived of its input, it activates at a later time in response to other, usually adjacent inputs.
Usually, damage of the somatosensory cortex results in impairment of the body perception.. Kaas' research project is focused on how these systems (somatosensory, cognitive, motor systems) respond with plastic changes resulting from injury.One recent study of neuroplasticity involves work done by a team of doctors and researchers at Emory University, specifically Dr.
Control studies show that these changes are not caused by sensory experience alone: they require learning about the sensory experience, they are strongest for the stimuli that are associated with reward, and they occur with equal ease in operant and classical conditioning behaviors.
An interesting phenomenon involving plasticity of cortical maps is the phenomenon of phantom limb sensation.. Phantom limb sensation is experienced by people who have undergone amputations in hands, arms, and legs, but it is not limited to extremities.
However, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2014 detailing the results of a multi-center NIH-funded phase III clinical trial of 882 patients found that treatment of acute traumatic brain injury with the hormone progesterone provides no significant benefit to patients when compared with placebo.


=== Vision ===
For decades, researchers assumed that humans had to acquire binocular vision, in particular stereopsis, in early childhood or they would never gain it.. In recent years, however, successful improvements in persons with amblyopia, convergence insufficiency or other stereo vision anomalies have become prime examples of neuroplasticity; binocular vision improvements and stereopsis recovery are now active areas of scientific and clinical research.


=== Brain training ===
Several companies have offered so-called cognitive training software programs for various purposes that claim to work via neuroplasticity; one example is Fast ForWord which is marketed to help children with learning disabilities.
He discovered that the cerebellums of the trained animals were substantially larger.. But these findings were eventually forgotten.
He has made some of "the most ambitious claims for the field – that brain exercises may be as useful as drugs to treat diseases as severe as schizophrenia – that plasticity exists from cradle to the grave, and that radical improvements in cognitive functioning – how we learn, think, perceive, and remember are possible even in the elderly." Merzenich's work was affected by a crucial discovery made by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in their work with kittens.. The experiment involved sewing one eye shut and recording the cortical brain maps.
Stein noticed that female mice seemed to recover from brain injuries better than male mice, and that at certain points in the estrus cycle, females recovered even better.. This difference may be attributed to different levels of progesterone, with higher levels of progesterone leading to the faster recovery from brain injury in mice.

In the somatic sensory system, in which this phenomenon has been most thoroughly investigated, JT Wall and J Xu have traced the mechanisms underlying this plasticity.. Re-organization is not cortically emergent, but occurs at every level in the processing hierarchy;  this produces the map changes observed in the cerebral cortex.Merzenich and William Jenkins (1990) initiated studies relating sensory experience, without pathological perturbation, to cortically observed plasticity in the primate somatosensory system, with the finding that sensory sites activated in an attended operant behavior increase in their cortical representation.
A redistribution of grey matter was indicated in London Taxi Drivers compared to controls.. This work on hippocampal plasticity not only interested scientists, but also engaged the public and media worldwide.

If two nearby neurons often produce an impulse in close temporal proximity, their functional properties may converge.. Conversely, neurons that are not regularly activated simultaneously may be less likely to functionally converge.


=== Cortical maps ===
Cortical organization, especially in sensory systems, is often described in terms of maps.
Hubel and Wiesel saw that the portion of the kitten's brain associated with the shut eye was not idle, as expected.. Instead, it processed visual information from the open eye.
These functional changes may be caused by changes in the physical structure of the brain.


=== Fitness and exercise ===

Aerobic exercise promotes adult neurogenesis by increasing the production of neurotrophic factors (compounds that promote growth or survival of neurons), such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).. Exercise-induced neurogenesis in the hippocampus is associated with measurable improvements in spatial memory.

Neuro Myths: Separating Fact and Fiction in Brain-Based Learning by Sara Bernard
Changes such as an excessive level of neuronal growth leading to spasticity or tonic paralysis, or excessive neurotransmitter release in response to injury that could result in nerve cell death, are considered as an example of "negative" plasticity.. In addition, drug addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder are both deemed examples of "negative plasticity" by Dr.
Robot assisted therapy is an emerging technique, which is also hypothesized to work by way of neuroplasticity, though there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the exact mechanisms of change when using this method.One group has developed a treatment that includes increased levels of progesterone injections in brain-injured patients.. "Administration of progesterone after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke reduces edema, inflammation, and neuronal cell death, and enhances spatial reference memory and sensory motor recovery." In a clinical trial, a group of severely injured patients had a 60% reduction in mortality after three days of progesterone injections.

Neuroplasticity is the fundamental issue that supports the scientific basis for treatment of acquired brain injury with goal-directed experiential therapeutic programs in the context of rehabilitation approaches to the functional consequences of the injury.
Neuroplasticity is gaining popularity as a theory that, at least in part, explains improvements in functional outcomes with physical therapy post-stroke.. Rehabilitation techniques that are supported by evidence which suggest cortical reorganization as the mechanism of change include constraint-induced movement therapy, functional electrical stimulation, treadmill training with body-weight support, and virtual reality therapy.
He gives as a first example of adaptation, to see upright with reversing glasses in the Stratton experiment, and specially, several first-hand brain injuries cases in which he observed dynamic and adaptive properties in their disorders, in particular in the inverted perception disorder [e.g., see pp 260–62 Vol.. I (1945), p 696 Vol.
In brief, a mutually agreed upon framework does not appear to exist.


=== Research and discovery ===
In 1923, Karl Lashley conducted experiments on rhesus monkeys that demonstrated changes in neuronal pathways, which he concluded were evidence of plasticity.. Despite this, and other research that suggested plasticity took place, neuroscientists did not widely accept the idea of neuroplasticity.
In 1945, Justo Gonzalo concluded from his research of brain dynamics, that, contrary to the activity of the projection areas, the "central" cortical mass (more or less equidistant from the visual, tactile and auditive projection areas), would be a "maneuvering mass", rather unspecific or multisensory, with capacity to increase neural excitability and re-organize the activity by means of  plasticity properties.
The areas representing digit one and five are not located directly beside the area representing digit three, so these regions remained, for the most part, unchanged following amputation.. This study demonstrates that only those regions that border a certain area invade it to alter the cortical map.

When a stimulus is cognitively associated with reinforcement, its cortical representation is strengthened and enlarged.. In some cases, cortical representations can increase two to threefold in 1–2 days when a new sensory motor behavior is first acquired, and changes are largely finalised within at most a few weeks.

However, clinical trials showed progesterone offers no significant benefit for traumatic brain injury human patients.


== History ==


=== Origin ===
The term "plasticity" was first applied to behavior in 1890 by William James in The Principles of Psychology.. The first person to use the term neural plasticity appears to have been the Polish neuroscientist Jerzy Konorski.In 1793, Italian anatomist Michele Vicenzo Malacarne described experiments in which he paired animals, trained one of the pair extensively for years, and then dissected both.
Studies in 2010 and 2011 using functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques have shown that parts of the brain associated with visual processing are adapted for the new skill of echolocation.. Studies with blind patients, for example, suggest that the click-echoes heard by these patients were processed by brain regions devoted to vision rather than audition.


=== ADHD stimulants ===
Reviews of MRI studies on individuals with ADHD suggest that the long-term treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with stimulants, such as amphetamine or methylphenidate, decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.


=== In children ===
Neuroplasticity is most active in childhood as a part of normal human development, and can also be seen as an especially important mechanism for children in terms of risk and resiliency.
The idea that the brain and its function are not fixed throughout adulthood was proposed in 1890 by William James in The Principles of Psychology, though the idea was largely neglected.. Until around the 1970s, neuroscientists believed that the brain's structure and function was essentially fixed throughout adulthood.The term has since seen broadly applied:

 Given the central importance of neuroplasticity, an outsider would be forgiven for assuming that it was well defined and that a basic and universal framework served to direct current and future hypotheses and experimentation.
Although the neurological basis of phantom limb sensation is still not entirely understood it is believed that cortical reorganization plays an important role.Norman Doidge, following the lead of Michael Merzenich, separates manifestations of neuroplasticity into adaptations that have positive or negative behavioral consequences.. For example, if an organism can recover after a stroke to normal levels of performance, that adaptiveness could be considered an example of "positive plasticity".
The brain had to be plastic." Merzenich received the 2016 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience "for the discovery of mechanisms that allow experience and neural activity to remodel brain function."

However, in 1995 Herta Flor and her colleagues demonstrated that cortical remapping occurs only in patients who have phantom pain.. Her research showed that phantom limb pain (rather than referred sensations) was the perceptual correlate of cortical reorganization.
Before amputation, there were five distinct areas, one corresponding to each digit of the experimental hand.. Sixty-two days following amputation of the third digit, the area in the cortical map formerly occupied by that digit had been invaded by the previously adjacent second and fourth digit zones.

Behavior, environmental stimuli, thought, and emotions may also cause neuroplastic change through activity-dependent plasticity, which has significant implications for healthy development, learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage.At the single cell level, synaptic plasticity refers to changes in the connections between neurons, whereas non-synaptic plasticity refers to changes in their intrinsic excitability.


== Neurobiology ==
One of the fundamental principles underlying neuroplasticity is based on the idea that individual synaptic connections are constantly being removed or recreated, largely dependent upon the activity of the neurons that bear them.. The activity-dependence of synaptic plasticity is captured in the aphorism which is often used to summarize Hebbian theory: "neurons that fire together, wire together"/"neurons that fire out of sync, fail to link".

Randy Nudo's group found that if a small stroke (an infarction) is induced by obstruction of blood flow to a portion of a monkey's motor cortex, the part of the body that responds by movement moves when areas adjacent to the damaged brain area are stimulated.
The Wall Street Journal.. Washington D.C.
Current research includes the tracking of changes that occur in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex as a result of a stroke.. Thus, events that occur in the reorganization process of the brain can be ascertained.
Similar results have been reported for phantom limb pain, chronic low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.


=== Meditation ===

A number of studies have linked meditation practice to differences in cortical thickness or density of gray matter.. One of the most well-known studies to demonstrate this was led by Sara Lazar, from Harvard University, in 2000.
17 (11): 550&ndash, 551.. doi:10.1016/j.tics.2013.08.010.
Sadly, however, this is not the case.. While many neuroscientists use the word neuroplasticity as an umbrella term it means different things to different researchers in different subfields ...
This phenomenon is related to neuroplasticity due to a maladaptive reorganization of the nervous system, both peripherally and centrally.. During the period of tissue damage, noxious stimuli and inflammation cause an elevation of nociceptive input from the periphery to the central nervous system.
Higher physical fitness scores (measured by VO2 max) are associated with better executive function, faster processing speed, and greater volume of the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and nucleus accumbens.


=== Human echolocation ===
Human echolocation is a learned ability for humans to sense their environment from echoes.. This ability is used by some blind people to navigate their environment and sense their surroundings in detail.
Prolonged nociception from the periphery then elicits a neuroplastic response at the cortical level to change its somatotopic organization for the painful site, inducing central sensitization.. For instance, individuals experiencing complex regional pain syndrome demonstrate a diminished cortical somatotopic representation of the hand contralaterally as well as a decreased spacing between the hand and the mouth.
An explanation for this is based on the concept of neuroplasticity, as the cortical maps of the removed limbs are believed to have become engaged with the area around them in the postcentral gyrus.. This results in activity within the surrounding area of the cortex being misinterpreted by the area of the cortex formerly responsible for the amputated limb.
The relationship between phantom limb sensation and neuroplasticity is a complex one.
This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as maladaptive plasticity.
In 2009 Lorimer Moseley and Peter Brugger carried out a remarkable experiment in which they encouraged arm amputee subjects to use visual imagery to contort their phantom limbs into impossible configurations.. Four of the seven subjects succeeded in performing impossible movements of the phantom limb.
The two scientists micromapped the hand maps of monkey brains before and after cutting a peripheral nerve and sewing the ends together.. Afterwards, the hand map in the brain that they expected to be jumbled was nearly normal.
Doidge, as the synaptic rewiring resulting in these behaviors is also highly maladaptive.A 2005 study found that the effects of neuroplasticity occur even more rapidly than previously expected.. Medical students' brains were imaged during the period of studying for their exams.
His first encounter with adult plasticity came when he was engaged in a postdoctoral study with Clinton Woosley.. The experiment was based on observation of what occurred in the brain when one peripheral nerve was cut and subsequently regenerated.
Consistent aerobic exercise over a period of several months induces marked clinically significant improvements in executive function (i.e., the "cognitive control" of behavior) and increased gray matter volume in multiple brain regions, particularly those that give rise to cognitive control.. The brain structures that show the greatest improvements in gray matter volume in response to aerobic exercise are the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus; moderate improvements are seen in the anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, and nucleus accumbens.
In one study, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) mapping techniques were used in nine normal monkeys.. Some underwent ischemic-infarction procedures and the others, ICMS procedures.

However, the degree of rewiring induced by the integration of new neurons in the established circuits is not known, and such rewiring may well be functionally redundant.There is now ample evidence for the active, experience-dependent re-organization of the synaptic networks of the brain involving multiple inter-related structures including the cerebral cortex.. The specific details of how this process occurs at the molecular and ultrastructural levels are topics of active neuroscience research.

Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity and neural plasticity, is the ability of the brain to change throughout an individual's life, e.g., brain activity associated with a given function can be transferred to a different location, the proportion of grey matter can change, and synapses may strengthen or weaken over time.
Research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are "plastic") even through adulthood.. However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain.Neuroplasticity can be observed at multiple scales, from microscopic changes in individual neurons to larger-scale changes such as cortical remapping in response to injury.
In songbirds, many song control nuclei in the brain increase in size during mating season.. Among birds, changes in brain morphology to influence song patterns, frequency, and volume are common.

For example, sensory information from the foot projects to one cortical site and the projections from the hand target another site.. As a result, the cortical representation of sensory inputs from the body resembles a somatotopic map, often described as the sensory homunculus.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, several groups began exploring the impact of interfering with sensory inputs on cortical map reorganization.

It was "…as though the brain didn't want to waste any 'cortical real estate' and had found a way to rewire itself."This implied neuroplasticity during the critical period.. However, Merzenich argued that neuroplasticity could occur beyond the critical period.
Trauma is considered a great risk as it negatively affects many areas of the brain and puts strain on the sympathetic nervous system from constant activation.. Trauma thus alters the brain's connections such that children who have experienced trauma may be hyper vigilant or overly aroused.

Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.Individual neuroscientists, however, often work on questions that span several distinct subfields.


== Neuroscience organizations ==

The largest professional neuroscience organization is the Society for Neuroscience (SFN), which is based in the United States but includes many members from other countries.. Since its founding in 1969 the SFN has grown steadily:  as of 2010 it recorded 40,290 members from 83 different countries.
The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, PET, SPECT), electrophysiology, and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates.. Although many studies still hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena, recent research shows that there is an interesting interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research, soliciting and integrating both perspectives.
Neurons are cells specialized for communication.. They are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses, at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another.
Psychiatry focuses on affective, behavioral, cognitive, and perceptual disorders.. Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain, and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness.
Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s.. During the same period, Schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the Biology Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, bringing together biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
In 1961–1962, Richard FitzHugh and J.. Nagumo simplified Hodgkin–Huxley, in what is called the FitzHugh–Nagumo model.
He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation—since most specialized organs (e.g., eyes, ears, tongue) are located in the head near the brain—but was also the seat of intelligence.. Plato also speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul.
Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations.. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
This was followed by the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School which was founded in 1966 by Stephen Kuffler.The understanding of neurons and of nervous system function became increasingly precise and molecular during the 20th century.. For example, in 1952, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley presented a mathematical model for transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid, which they called "action potentials", and how they are initiated and propagated, known as the Hodgkin–Huxley model.
In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the Morris–Lecar model.. Such increasingly quantitative work gave rise to numerous biological neuron models.


== Modern neuroscience ==
 

The scientific study of the nervous system increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century, principally due to advances in molecular biology, electrophysiology, and computational neuroscience.
In Renaissance Europe, Vesalius (1514–1564), René Descartes (1596–1650), and Thomas Willis (1621–1675) also made several contributions to neuroscience.

In the first half of the 19th century, Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of carrying out localized lesions of the brain in living animals describing their effects on motricity, sensibility and behavior.. Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during the late 1890s.
In many species — including all vertebrates — the nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body, with most of the complexity residing in the brain.. The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses; it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures, connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled.
In 1962, Bernard Katz modeled neurotransmission across the space between neurons known as synapses.. Beginning in 1966, Eric Kandel and collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage in Aplysia.
Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively.. Despite many advancements, the way that networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood.


=== Cognitive and behavioral neuroscience ===

At the cognitive level, cognitive neuroscience addresses the questions of how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry.
For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does vision work?. How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound?
Many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon, which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals, influencing the activity of other neurons, muscles, or glands at their termination points.. A nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other.
In vertebrates, the nervous system can be split into two parts, the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and the peripheral nervous system.
Eric Kandel and collaborators have cited David Rioch, Francis O.. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing the field.
The understanding of the biological basis of learning, memory, behavior, perception and consciousness has been described by Eric Kandel as the "ultimate challenge" of the biological sciences.The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the nervous system at the different scales and the techniques used by neuroscientists have expanded enormously, from molecular and cellular studies of individual neurons to imaging of sensory and motor tasks in the brain.. Neuroscience has also given rise to such other disciplines as neuroeducation, neuroethics, and neurolaw.
As a result of the increasing number of scientists who study the nervous system, several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists and educators.
Annual meetings, held each year in a different American city, draw attendance from researchers, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates, as well as educational institutions, funding agencies, publishers, and hundreds of businesses that supply products used in research.
Other major organizations devoted to neuroscience include the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO), which holds its meetings in a country from a different part of the world each year, and the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies (FENS), which holds a meeting in a different European city every two years.. FENS comprises a set of 32 national-level organizations, including the British Neuroscience Association, the German Neuroscience Society (Neurowissenschaftliche Gesellschaft), and the French Société des Neurosciences.
The first freestanding neuroscience department (then called Psychobiology) was founded in 1964 at the University of California, Irvine by James L.. McGaugh.
For example, the neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interesting interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy, psychology and psychopathology.. Moreover, the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past, supporting a view of memory as a generative, constructive and dynamic process.Neuroscience is also allied with the social and behavioral sciences as well as nascent interdisciplinary fields such as neuroeconomics, decision theory, social neuroscience, and neuromarketing to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment.
Over the long term, improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress.. Developments in electron microscopy, computers, electronics, functional brain imaging, and most recently genetics and genomics, have all been major drivers of progress.


=== Translational research and medicine ===

Neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, psychosurgery, anesthesiology and pain medicine, neuropathology, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, clinical neurophysiology, addiction medicine, and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the diseases of the nervous system.
Thus the challenge of making sense of all this complexity is formidable.


=== Molecular and cellular neuroscience ===

The study of the nervous system can be done at multiple levels, ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels.. At the molecular level, the basic questions addressed in molecular neuroscience include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how axons form complex connectivity patterns.
These questions include the patterning and regionalization of the nervous system, neural stem cells, differentiation of neurons and glia, neuronal migration, axonal and dendritic development, trophic interactions, and synapse formation.
Computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.


=== Neural circuits and systems ===

At the systems level, the questions addressed in systems neuroscience include how biological neural networks or neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory.. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated.
Neuroscience (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system.. It is a multidisciplinary branch of biology, that combines physiology, anatomy, molecular biology, developmental biology, cytology, mathematical modeling and psychology to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons and neural circuits.
These questions include how signals are processed by neurites – thin extensions from a neuronal cell body, consisting of dendrites (specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons) and axons (specialized to conduct nerve impulses called action potentials) – and somas (the cell bodies of the neurons containing the nucleus), and how neurotransmitters and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron.. Another major area of neuroscience is directed at investigations of the development of the nervous system.
This has allowed neuroscientists to study the nervous system in all its aspects:  how it is structured, how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be changed.. For example, it has become possible to understand, in much detail, the complex processes occurring within a single neuron.
Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions, and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain.. While Luigi Galvani's pioneering work in the late 1700s had set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons, it was in the late 19th century that Emil du Bois-Reymond, Johannes Peter Müller, and Hermann von Helmholtz demonstrated that the electrical excitation of neurons predictably affected the electrical states of adjacent neurons, and Richard Caton found electrical phenomena in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys.
In parallel with this research, work with brain-damaged patients by Paul Broca suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions.
How does the somatosensory system process tactile information?. The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors.
Aristotle, however, believed the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain regulated the amount of heat from the heart.. This view was generally accepted until the Roman physician Galen, a follower of Hippocrates and physician to Roman gladiators, observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains.
Abulcasis, Averroes, Avicenna, Avenzoar, and  Maimonides, active in the Medieval Muslim world, described a number of medical problems related to the brain.
The procedure used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual neurons.. His technique was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron.
For example, the International Brain Research Organization was founded in 1960, the International Society for Neurochemistry in 1963, the European Brain and Behaviour Society in 1968, and the Society for Neuroscience in 1969.


== History ==

The earliest study of the nervous system dates to ancient Egypt.. Trepanation, the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull for the purpose of curing headaches or mental disorders, or relieving cranial pressure, was first recorded during the Neolithic period.
At this level, tools from molecular biology and genetics are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions.. The morphology, molecular identity, and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest.
The fundamental questions addressed in cellular neuroscience include the mechanisms of how neurons process signals physiologically and electrochemically.
The first National Honor Society in Neuroscience, Nu Rho Psi, was founded in 2006.
In 2013, the BRAIN Initiative was announced in the US.


=== Public education and outreach ===
In addition to conducting traditional research in laboratory settings, neuroscientists have also been involved in the promotion of awareness and knowledge about the nervous system among the general public and government officials.. Such promotions have been done by both individual neuroscientists and large organizations.
In Canada, the CIHR Canadian National Brain Bee is held annually at McMaster University.Neuroscience educators formed Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience (FUN) in 1992 to share best practices and provide travel awards for undergraduates presenting at Society for Neuroscience meetings.
Finally, neuroscientists have also collaborated with other education experts to study and refine educational techniques to optimize learning among students, an emerging field called educational neuroscience.. Federal agencies in the United States, such as the National Institute of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF), have also funded research that pertains to best practices in teaching and learning of neuroscience concepts.

The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience.. Brain imaging also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.Integrative neuroscience makes connections across these specialized areas of focus.


== Major branches ==
Modern neuroscience education and research activities can be very roughly categorized into the following major branches, based on the subject and scale of the system in examination as well as distinct experimental or curricular approaches.Transporters, or membrane transport proteins, pump neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft back into axon terminals (the presynaptic neuron) where they are stored.For example, choline is taken up and recycled by the pre-synaptic neuron to synthesize more ACh.. Other neurotransmitters such as dopamine are able to diffuse away from their targeted synaptic junctions and are eliminated from the body via the kidneys, or destroyed in the liver.
Some studies suggest that having too little or too much dopamine or problems using dopamine in the thinking and feeling regions of the brain may play a role in disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).. Similarly, after some research suggested that drugs that block the recycling, or reuptake, of serotonin seemed to help some people diagnosed with depression, it was theorized that people with depression might have lower-than-normal serotonin levels.
Excessive glutamate release can overstimulate the brain and lead to excitotoxicity causing cell death resulting in seizures or strokes.. Excitotoxicity has been implicated in certain chronic diseases including ischemic stroke, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, and Parkinson's disease.
GABA is used at the great majority of fast inhibitory synapses in virtually every part of the brain.
Drugs such as tetrodotoxin that block neural activity are typically lethal.
Drugs targeting the neurotransmitter of major systems affect the whole system, which can explain the complexity of action of some drugs.. Cocaine, for example, blocks the re-uptake of dopamine back into the presynaptic neuron, leaving the neurotransmitter molecules in the synaptic gap for an extended period of time.
Some drugs block or stimulate the release of specific neurotransmitters.. Alternatively, drugs can prevent neurotransmitter storage in synaptic vesicles by causing the synaptic vesicle membranes to leak.
The paralytic arrow-poison curare acts by blocking transmission at these synapses.. Acetylcholine also operates in many regions of the brain, but using different types of receptors, including nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.
Dopamine has a number of important functions in the brain; this includes regulation of motor behavior, pleasures related to motivation and also emotional arousal.
For depressed patients where low activity of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine is implicated, there is only little evidence for benefit of neurotransmitter precursor administration.. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are both precursors for dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
It is significantly more effective than a placebo in the treatment of mild and moderate depression.. This conversion requires vitamin C.
A brief comparison of these systems follows:


== Drug effects ==
Understanding the effects of drugs on neurotransmitters comprises a significant portion of research initiatives in the field of neuroscience.. Most neuroscientists involved in this field of research believe that such efforts may further advance our understanding of the circuits responsible for various neurological diseases and disorders, as well as ways to effectively treat and someday possibly prevent or cure such illnesses.Drugs can influence behavior by altering neurotransmitter activity.
It functions to regulate appetite, sleep, memory and learning, temperature, mood, behaviour, muscle contraction, and function of the cardiovascular system and endocrine system.. It is speculated to have a role in depression, as some depressed patients are seen to have lower concentrations of metabolites of serotonin in their cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.
Norepinephrine which is synthesized in the central nervous system and sympathetic nerves, modulates the responses of the autonomic nervous system, the sleep patterns, focus and alertness.
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also a precursor for serotonin, is more effective than a placebo.


== Diseases and disorders ==
Diseases and disorders may also affect specific neurotransmitter systems.. For example, problems in producing dopamine can result in Parkinson's disease, a disorder that affects a person's ability to move as they want to, resulting in stiffness, tremors or shaking, and other symptoms.
Nevertheless, short-term exposure of the receptor to a neurotransmitter is typically sufficient for causing a postsynaptic response by way of synaptic transmission.
In response to a threshold action potential or graded electrical potential, a neurotransmitter is released at the presynaptic terminal.. Low level "baseline" release also occurs without electrical stimulation.
Apart from recreational use, medications that directly and indirectly interact one or more transmitter or its receptor are commonly prescribed for psychiatric and psychological issues.. Notably, drugs interacting with serotonin and norepinephrine are prescribed to patients with problems such as depression and anxiety—though the notion that there is much solid medical evidence to support such interventions has been widely criticized.


== Elimination of neurotransmitters ==
A neurotransmitter must be broken down once it reaches the post-synaptic cell to prevent further excitatory or inhibitory signal transduction.
Major neurotransmitter systems include the noradrenaline (norepinephrine) system, the dopamine system, the serotonin system, and the cholinergic system, among others.. Trace amines have a modulatory effect on neurotransmission in monoamine pathways (i.e., dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin pathways) throughout the brain via signaling through trace amine-associated receptor 1.
If the message is to be stopped, it is best stopped by applying inhibition on the cell body, close to the axon hillock where the action potential originates.. Another way to conceptualize excitatory–inhibitory interaction is to picture excitation overcoming inhibition.
Therefore, the effects of a neurotransmitter system depend on the connections of the neurons that use the transmitter, and the chemical properties of the receptors that the transmitter binds to.
Here are a few examples of important neurotransmitter actions:

Glutamate is used at the great majority of fast excitatory synapses in the brain and spinal cord.. It is also used at most synapses that are "modifiable", i.e.
An antagonist may also be called a receptor "blocker" because they block the effect of an agonist at the site.. The pharmacological effects of an antagonist therefore result in preventing the corresponding receptor site's agonists (e.g., drugs, hormones, neurotransmitters) from binding to and activating it.
Typically, neurotransmitter receptors are located on the postsynaptic neuron, while neurotransmitter autoreceptors are located on the presynaptic neuron, as is the case for monoamine neurotransmitters; in some cases, a neurotransmitter utilizes retrograde neurotransmission, a type of feedback signaling in neurons where the neurotransmitter is released postsynaptically and binds to target receptors located on the presynaptic neuron.. Nicotine, a compound found in tobacco, is a direct agonist of most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, mainly located in cholinergic neurons.
The released neurotransmitter may then move across the synapse to be detected by and bind with receptors in the postsynaptic neuron.. Binding of neurotransmitters may influence the postsynaptic neuron in either an inhibitory or excitatory way.
Opiates, such as morphine, heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, and methadone, are μ-opioid receptor agonists; this action mediates their euphoriant and pain relieving properties.Indirect agonists increase the binding of neurotransmitters at their target receptors by stimulating the release or preventing the reuptake of neurotransmitters.. Some indirect agonists trigger neurotransmitter release and prevent neurotransmitter reuptake.
The next neuron may be connected to many more neurons, and if the total of excitatory influences minus inhibitory influences is great enough, it will also "fire".. That is to say, it will create a new action potential at its axon hillock, releasing neurotransmitters and passing on the information to yet another neighboring neuron.


=== Excitatory and inhibitory ===
A neurotransmitter can influence the function of a neuron through a remarkable number of mechanisms.
An example of a receptor agonist is morphine, an opiate that mimics effects of the endogenous neurotransmitter β-endorphin to relieve pain.. Other drugs interfere with the deactivation of a neurotransmitter after it has been released, thereby prolonging the action of a neurotransmitter.
The gases are produced in the neural cytoplasm and are immediately diffused through the cell membrane into the extracellular fluid and into nearby cells to stimulate production of second messengers.. Soluble gas neurotransmitters are difficult to study, as they act rapidly and are immediately broken down, existing for only a few seconds.
The most prevalent transmitter is glutamate, which is excitatory at well over 90% of the synapses in the human brain.
This can be accomplished by blocking re-uptake or inhibiting degradative enzymes.. Lastly, drugs can also prevent an action potential from occurring, blocking neuronal activity throughout the central and peripheral nervous system.
This allows new signals to be produced from the adjacent nerve cells.. When the neurotransmitter has been secreted into the synaptic cleft, it binds to specific receptors on the postsynaptic cell, thereby generating a postsynaptic electrical signal.
Each neurotransmitter has very specific degradation pathways at regulatory points, which may be targeted by the body's regulatory system or by recreational drugs.

These conversions require vitamin B6, vitamin C, and S-adenosylmethionine.. A few studies suggest potential antidepressant effects of L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine, but there is much room for further research in this area.


==== Serotonin precursors ====
Administration of L-tryptophan, a precursor for serotonin, is seen to double the production of serotonin in the brain.
In its direct actions in influencing a neuron's electrical excitability, however, a neurotransmitter acts in only one of two ways: excitatory or inhibitory.. A neurotransmitter influences trans-membrane ion flow either to increase (excitatory) or to decrease (inhibitory) the probability that the cell with which it comes in contact will produce an action potential.
It plays a critical role in the reward system; Parkinson's disease has been linked to low levels of dopamine and schizophrenia has been linked to high levels of dopamine.
Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter.. Most is produced by and found in the intestine (approximately 90%), and the remainder in central nervous system neurons.
Competitive antagonists, therefore, can be characterized as shifting the dose-response relationship for the agonist to the right.. In the presence of a competitive antagonist, it takes an increased concentration of the agonist to produce the same response observed in the absence of the antagonist.
An irreversible antagonist binds so strongly to the receptor as to render the receptor unavailable for binding to the agonist.
Even with increased neurotransmitter release, it is unclear whether this will result in a long-term increase in neurotransmitter signal strength, since the nervous system can adapt to changes such as increased neurotransmitter synthesis and may therefore maintain constant firing.. Some neurotransmitters may have a role in depression and there is some evidence to suggest that intake of precursors of these neurotransmitters may be useful in the treatment of mild and moderate depression.


==== Catecholamine and trace amine precursors ====
L-DOPA, a precursor of dopamine that crosses the blood–brain barrier, is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
This neuron may be connected to many more neurons, and if the total of excitatory influences are greater than those of inhibitory influences, the neuron will also "fire".. Ultimately it will create a new action potential at its axon hillock to release neurotransmitters and pass on the information to yet another neighboring neuron.


== Discovery ==
Until the early 20th century, scientists assumed that the majority of synaptic communication in the brain was electrical.
After the effects of the drug wear off, an individual can become depressed due to decreased probability of the neurotransmitter binding to a receptor.. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), which blocks re-uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic cell which increases the amount of serotonin present at the synapse and furthermore allows it to remain there longer, providing potential for the effect of naturally released serotonin.
Antagonists may be "competitive" or "irreversible".
A competitive antagonist competes with an agonist for binding to the receptor.. As the concentration of antagonist increases, the binding of the agonist is progressively inhibited, resulting in a decrease in the physiological response.
Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles in synapses into the synaptic cleft, where they are received by neurotransmitter receptors on the target cells.. Many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as amino acids, which are readily available from the diet and only require a small number of biosynthetic steps for conversion.
Furthermore, Otto Loewi is credited with discovering acetylcholine (ACh)—the first known neurotransmitter.. Some neurons do, however, communicate via electrical synapses through the use of gap junctions, which allow specific ions to pass directly from one cell to another.


== Identification ==
There are four main criteria for identifying neurotransmitters:

The chemical must be synthesized in the neuron or otherwise be present in it.
When the neuron is active, the chemical must be released and produce a response in some target.
The same response must be obtained when the chemical is experimentally placed on the target.
A mechanism must exist for removing the chemical from its site of activation after its work is done.However, given advances in pharmacology, genetics, and chemical neuroanatomy, the term "neurotransmitter" can be applied to chemicals that:

Carry messages between neurons via influence on the postsynaptic membrane.
Have little or no effect on membrane voltage, but have a common carrying function such as changing the structure of the synapse.
Communicate by sending reverse-direction messages that affect the release or reuptake of transmitters.The anatomical localization of neurotransmitters is typically determined using immunocytochemical techniques, which identify the location of either the transmitter substances themselves, or of the enzymes that are involved in their synthesis.
The transmitter must then be removed rapidly to enable the postsynaptic cell to engage in another cycle of neurotransmitter release, binding, and signal generation.. Neurotransmitters are terminated in three different ways:

Diffusion – the neurotransmitter detaches from receptor, drifting out of the synaptic cleft, here it becomes absorbed by glial cells.
Enzyme degradation – special chemicals called enzymes break it down.
Reuptake – re-absorption of a neurotransmitter into the neuron.
Strong imbalances or disruptions to neurotransmitter systems have been associated with many diseases and mental disorders.. These include Parkinson's, depression, insomnia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety, memory loss, dramatic changes in weight and addictions.
In addition, Type I synapses have round synaptic vesicles, whereas the vesicles of type II synapses are flattened.. The material on the presynaptic and post-synaptic membranes is denser in a Type I synapse than it is in a type II, and the type I synaptic cleft is wider.
The next most prevalent is Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, or GABA, which is inhibitory at more than 90% of the synapses that do not use glutamate.. Although other transmitters are used in fewer synapses, they may be very important functionally: the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering the actions of some neurotransmitter systems, often acting through transmitters other than glutamate or GABA.
Through a series of experiments involving the vagus nerves of frogs, Loewi was able to manually slow the heart rate of frogs by controlling the amount of saline solution present around the vagus nerve.. Upon completion of this experiment, Loewi asserted that sympathetic regulation of cardiac function can be mediated through changes in chemical concentrations.
When an action potential arrives at the synapse's presynaptic terminal button, it may stimulate the release of neurotransmitters.. These neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft to bind onto the receptors of the postsynaptic membrane and influence another cell, either in an inhibitory or excitatory way.
Since the dopamine remains in the synapse longer, the neurotransmitter continues to bind to the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, eliciting a pleasurable emotional response.. Physical addiction to cocaine may result from prolonged exposure to excess dopamine in the synapses, which leads to the downregulation of some post-synaptic receptors.
Other drugs act by binding to a receptor and mimicking the normal neurotransmitter.. Such drugs are called receptor agonists.
For instance, drugs can decrease the rate of synthesis of neurotransmitters by affecting the synthetic enzyme(s) for that neurotransmitter.. When neurotransmitter syntheses are blocked, the amount of neurotransmitters available for release becomes substantially lower, resulting in a decrease in neurotransmitter activity.
Finally, the active zone on a Type I synapse is larger than that on a Type II synapse.
The different locations of type I and type II synapses divide a neuron into two zones: an excitatory dendritic tree and an inhibitory cell body.. From an inhibitory perspective, excitation comes in over the dendrites and spreads to the axon hillock to trigger an action potential.
Each neuron has as many as 15,000 connections with neighboring neurons.
Neurons do not touch each other (except in the case of an electrical synapse through a gap junction); instead, neurons interact at contact points called synapses: a junction within two nerve cells, consisting of a miniature gap within which impulses are carried by a neurotransmitter.. A neuron transports its information by way of a nerve impulse called an action potential.
Neurotransmitters are released into and diffuse across the synaptic cleft, where they bind to specific receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron.Most neurotransmitters are about the size of a single amino acid, however, some neurotransmitters may be the size of larger proteins or peptides.. A released neurotransmitter is typically available in the synaptic cleft for a short time before it is metabolized by enzymes, pulled back into the presynaptic neuron through reuptake, or bound to a postsynaptic receptor.
It is in most cases pragmatically impossible to even measure levels of neurotransmitters in a brain or body at any distinct moments in time.. Neurotransmitters regulate each other's release, and weak consistent imbalances in this mutual regulation were linked to temperament in healthy people 
.
However, through the careful histological examinations by Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934), a 20 to 40 nm gap between neurons, known today as the synaptic cleft, was discovered.. The presence of such a gap suggested communication via chemical messengers traversing the synaptic cleft, and in 1921 German pharmacologist Otto Loewi (1873–1961) confirmed that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals.
Each type has a different appearance and is located on different parts of the neurons under its influence.. Each neuron receives thousands of excitatory and inhibitory signals every second.Type I (excitatory) synapses are typically located on the shafts or the spines of dendrites, whereas type II (inhibitory) synapses are typically located on a cell body.
Neurotransmitters play a major role in shaping everyday life and functions.. Their exact numbers are unknown, but more than 200 chemical messengers have been uniquely identified.


== Mechanism ==

Neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles, clustered close to the cell membrane at the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron.
If the cell body is normally in an inhibited state, the only way to generate an action potential at the axon hillock is to reduce the cell body's inhibition.. In this "open the gates" strategy, the excitatory message is like a racehorse ready to run down the track, but first the inhibitory starting gate must be removed.


=== Examples of important neurotransmitter actions ===
As explained above, the only direct action of a neurotransmitter is to activate a receptor.
It is synthesized from tyrosine.
Epinephrine which is also synthesized from tyrosine is released in the adrenal glands and the brainstem.. It plays a role in sleep, with ones ability to become and stay alert, and the fight-or-flight response.
Histamine works with the central nervous system (CNS), specifically the hypothalamus (tuberomammillary nucleus) and CNS mast cells.


== Brain neurotransmitter systems ==
Neurons expressing certain types of neurotransmitters sometimes form distinct systems, where activation of the system affects large volumes of the brain, called volume transmission.
Amphetamine, for example, is an indirect agonist of postsynaptic dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin receptors in each their respective neurons; it produces both neurotransmitter release into the presynaptic neuron and subsequently the synaptic cleft and prevents their reuptake from the synaptic cleft by activating TAAR1, a presynaptic G protein-coupled receptor, and binding to a site on VMAT2, a type of monoamine transporter located on synaptic vesicles within monoamine neurons.


=== Antagonists ===

An antagonist is a chemical that acts within the body to reduce the physiological activity of another chemical substance (as an opiate); especially one that opposes the action on the nervous system of a drug or a substance occurring naturally in the body by combining with and blocking its nervous receptor.There are two main types of antagonist: direct-acting Antagonist and indirect-acting Antagonists:

Direct-acting antagonist- which takes up space present on receptors which are otherwise taken up by neurotransmitters themselves.. This results in neurotransmitters being blocked from binding to the receptors.
Dividing them into amino acids, peptides, and monoamines is sufficient for some classification purposes.
Major neurotransmitters:

Amino acids: glutamate, aspartate, D-serine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine
Gasotransmitters: nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
Monoamines: dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (noradrenaline; NE, NA), epinephrine (adrenaline), histamine, serotonin (SER, 5-HT)
Trace amines: phenethylamine, N-methylphenethylamine, tyramine, 3-iodothyronamine, octopamine, tryptamine, etc.
Peptides: somatostatin, substance P, cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, opioid peptides
Purines: adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine
Others: acetylcholine (ACh), anandamide, etc.In addition, over 50 neuroactive peptides have been found, and new ones are discovered regularly.. Many of these are "co-released" along with a small-molecule transmitter.
Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemicals that enable neurotransmission.. It is a type of chemical messenger which transmits signals across a chemical synapse, such as a neuromuscular junction, from one neuron (nerve cell) to another "target" neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.It is an interdisciplinary science that links the diverse fields of neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology, electrical engineering, computer science, physics and mathematics.

=== Neurology ===
Neurology is the medical specialty dealing with disorders of the nervous system.These extremely numerous subpallial cells are all inhibitory.. The olfactory bulb is thus singularly formed by a minority of autochthonous pallial neurons and a majority of immigrated inhibitory subpallial cells (it is nevertheless classified as a part of the ventral pallium).
The hypopallial region is also known as the dorsal ventricular ridge, described as having anterior and posterior (amygdaloid) regions.. Birds essentially show much increased cellularity, keeping within the reptilian morphological schema, which leads to the apparent disappearance of layering within its medial and dorsal pallial sectors.
The olfactory cortex is much reduced, whereas the hypopallial or dorsal ventricular ridge nuclei increase significantly in size and relative differentiation.


== See also ==
Avian pallium
Arcopallium
Nidopallium


== References ==
There is also a modified accessory olfactory bulb at the base of the principal one, which is associated specifically to incoming afferents from Jacobson's organ found at the nasal septum.. The accessory olfactory pathway is maximally developed in some reptiles (e.g., snakes) and is lost in birds.


== Evolution ==
The evolution of the dorsal pallium is not fully understood yet.
The septum is continuous with the preoptic area across the plane defined by the anterior commissure; it is largely subpallial, but also contains a small pallial portion, where the hippocampal commissure forms, which is contiguous to the medial pallium.. The telencephalic part of the rostral choroidal tela (roof plate continuous caudally with a diencephalic part) is inserted at the back of this commissure at a locus where mammals show the subfornical circumventricular organ, and extends laterally over the interventricular foramen into a wing-shaped medial telencephalic territory, the so-called choroidal fissure.
This structure is very similar to that found generally in anamniotes, though cartilaginous fishes do show a layered arrangement of their pallial neurons.


== In reptiles and birds ==
Reptiles developed a distinct three-layered structure of medial and dorsal portions of their pallium, a morphological schema referred to with the concept of allocortex.. In contrast, the lateral and ventral pallium sectors of reptiles adopted hypopallial structure (superficial olfactory cortex, covering deep pallial nuclei).
The pallial portions build the analytic or perceptual end of this complex, whereas the subpallial portions represent the corresponding output or efferent functional pole.
The olfactory bulb is a peculiar pallial outgrowth (maybe induced by the primary olfactory fibers afferent to it, coming from the sensory neurons developed in the olfactory placode) whose projection neurons (the mitral and tufted neurons) are pallial in origin and accordingly excitatory.. In contrast, the superfial periglomerulary neurons, various intermediate interneurons and the deep granule cells are all of subpallial origin and migrate tangentially out of the striatal part of the subpallium (apparently from a dorsal subsector of this domain) through the so-called rostral migratory stream into the olfactory bulb.
It is widely believed to be the progenitor of the bulk of the mammalian cerebral cortex, although the evidence for this is considered by some anatomists not yet to be conclusive.Importantly, the lateral and ventral parts of the pallium produce also deep to their respective sectors of subpial olfactory cortex sets of pallial nuclei, the neurons entering the claustrum, rostrally, and the pallial amygdala, caudally.. The concept of hypopallium refers to this histogenetically unitary complex of olfactory (piriform) cortex and deep pallial nuclei.
In basal vertebrates the pallium is a relatively simple three-layered structure, encompassing 3-4 histogenetically distinct domains, plus the olfactory bulb.. It used to be thought that pallium equals cortex and subpallium equals telencephalic nuclei, but it has turned out, according to comparative evidence provided by molecular markers, that the pallium develops both cortical structures (allocortex and isocortex) and pallial nuclei (claustroamygdaloid complex), whereas the subpallium develops striatal, pallidal, diagonal-innominate and preoptic nuclei, plus the corticoid structure of the olfactory tuberculum.
The subpallium region has distinct striatal, pallidal, diagonal and preoptic subregions, which are stretched obliquely between the septal midline and the amygdala at the posterior pole of the telencephalon.. At least the striatum, pallidum and diagonal domains extend into the amygdala, representing there the subpallial amygdala, forming its central and medial nucleis, as well as the amygdaloid end of the bed nucleus stria terminalis complex.
The amygdala thus encompasses an heterogeneous group of subpallial nuclei and hypopallial olfactory and amygdalohippocampal corticonuclear cell masses which are on the whole heavily involved in emotion and motivation.
However, the pallial portions do not show a visible lamination.. They already have a mixture of glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons, whereas the subpallium is largely populated by inhibitory neurons.
Here the choroidal tissue is attached to the fimbria of the hippocampus (also known as the cortical hem area), bordering lengthwise the medial pallium.. At its rostral and caudal ends, the medial pallium contacts the ventral pallium, which builds the pallial portion that contacts the subpallium across the pallio subpallial boundary, observed at the lateral telencephalic wall.
In mammals, the cortical part of the pallium registers a definite evolutionary step-up in complexity, forming the cerebral cortex, most of which consists of a progressively expanded six-layered portion isocortex, with simpler three-layered cortical regions allocortex at the margins.. The allocortex subdivides into hippocampal allocortex, medially, and olfactory allocortex, laterally (including rostrally the olfactory bulb and anterior olfactory areas).


== Structure ==
The general layout or body plan of the pallium is already clearly defined in animals with relatively simple brains, including lampreys, sharks and amphibians.
In neuroanatomy, pallium refers to the layers of grey and white matter that cover the upper surface of the cerebrum in vertebrates.. The non-pallial part of the telencephalon builds the subpallium.
The telencephalic pallium has been described classically as having three parts: the archipallium, the paleopallium and the neopallium, but these concepts are now considered obsolete, having been substituted by the concept of medial pallium, dorsal pallium, lateral pallium and ventral pallium mentioned above under pallial Bauplan.. It used to be said in anatomy textbooks that pallium equals cortex and subpallium equals telencephalic nuclei, but it has turned out, according to molecular markers, that the pallium develops both cortical structures (allocortex and isocortex) and pallial nuclei (claustroamygdaloid complex), whereas the subpallium develops striatal, pallidal, diagonal-innominate and preoptic nuclei, plus the corticoid structure of the olfactory tuberculum.


== In amphibians and other anamniotes ==
In amphibians, the telencephalon distinctly shows medial, dorsal, lateral and ventral parts of the pallium, plus striatal, pallidal, diagonal and preoptic parts of the basal nuclei.
The old lateral pallium encompassed the modern lateral and ventral parts of the pallium.. The medial pallium is the progenitor of the mammalian hippocampus, and is thought to be involved in spatial cognitive mapping and memory formation across a broad range of species.
The lateral and ventral pallium is the progenitor of the mammalian piriform cortex, and has an olfactory function in every species in which it has been studied.. The evolutionary diversifications and specialization in functions of the dorsal pallium have been more difficult to decipher.
In reptiles and birds the hypopallium becomes differentially enlarged (largest in crocodiles and birds, whose olfactory cortex gets nevertheless reduced), whereas in mammals it becomes reduced to the claustroamygdaloid complex and relatively enlarged olfactory (prepiriform and piriform) cortex.
The pallial amygdala contains mainly the so-called basolateral amygdala, encompassing the lateral, basolateral (basal) and basomedial (accessory basal) nuclei, plus the anterior, amygdalopiriform and posterolateral corticoid areas at its surface.. The medial pallium also may contribute to the pallial amygdala, forming the amygdalohippocampal nucleus and the posteromedial corticoid area.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.In this view, emotions are inherited biologically based modules that cannot be broken down into more basic psychological components.. Models following a locationist approach to emotion hypothesize that all mental states belonging to a single emotional category can be consistently and specifically localized to either a distinct brain region or a defined networks of brain regions.
Deep, emotional attachment to a subject area allows a deeper understanding of the material and therefore, learning occurs and lasts.. When reading, the emotions one is feeling in comparison to the emotions being portrayed in the content affects ones comprehension.
Special Issue on Affective Neuroscience.
Consistency was first assessed by comparing the ALE map generated across studies for each emotion (for example, the ALE map identifying regions consistently activated by studies inducing fear) to ALE map generated by random permutations.. Discriminability was then assessed by pair-wise contrasts of individual emotion ALE maps (for example, fear ALE map vs.
For the first time, happiness was discriminated from the other emotional categories, with the largest clusters of activity specific to happiness (vs.. the other emotion categories) located in right superior temporal gyrus and left rostral anterior cingulate cortex.
A derivation of the original go/no-go paradigm, this task involves a combination of affective “go cues”, where the participant must make a motor response as quickly as possible, and affective “no-go cues,” where a response must be withheld.. Because “go cues” are more common, the task is able to measure one’s ability to inhibit a response under different emotional conditions.The task is common in tests of emotion regulation, and is often paired with neuroimaging measures to localize relevant brain function in both healthy individuals and those with affective disorders.
Increased amygdala activation during fear was the most consistently reported across induction methods (but not specific).. Both meta-analyses also reported increased activations in regions of the anterior cingulate cortex during sadness, although this finding was less consistent (across induction methods) and was not specific to sadness.
The distinction between non-emotional and emotional processes is now thought to be largely artificial, as the two types of processes often involve overlapping neural and mental mechanisms.. Thus, when cognition is taken at its broadest definition, affective neuroscience could also be called the cognitive neuroscience of emotion.


== Cognitive neuroscience tasks in affective neuroscience research ==


=== Emotion Go/No-Go ===
The emotion go/no-go task has been frequently used to study behavioral inhibition, particularly emotional modulation of this inhibition.
2003).. In this review, the authors examined the locationist hypothesis by comparing the consistency and specificity of prior meta-analytic findings specific to each hypothesized basic emotion (fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and happiness).
FPS studies have demonstrated that PTSD patients have enhanced startle responses during both danger cues and neutral/safety cues as compared with healthy participants.


== Learning ==
There are many ways affect plays a role during learning.. Recently, affective neuroscience has done much to discover this role.
In fact, anxious participants in some studies show the Stroop interference effect for both negative and positive words, when the words are matched for emotionality.. This means that the specificity effects for various disorders may be largely attributable to the semantic relation of the words to the concerns of the disorder, rather than simply the emotionality of the words.


=== Ekman 60 faces task ===
The Ekman faces task is used to measure emotion recognition of six basic emotions.
In general, participants have more difficulty detaching attention from affectively valenced words, than neutral words.. This interference from valenced words is measured by the response latency in naming the color of neutral words as compared with emotional words.This task has been often used to test selective attention to threatening and other negatively valenced stimuli, most often in relation to psychopathology.
The subgenual cingulate is more active during both experimentally induced sadness and during depressive episodes.


=== Other brain structures related to emotion ===
Basal ganglia – Basal ganglia are groups of nuclei found on either side of the thalamus.. Basal ganglia play an important role in motivation, action selection and reward learning.
Orbitofrontal cortex – Is a major structure involved in decision making and the influence by emotion on that decision.
Prefrontal cortex – The term prefrontal cortex refers to the very front of the brain, behind the forehead and above the eyes.
In each meta-analysis, studies were included that investigate healthy, unmedicated adults and that used subtraction analysis to examine the areas of the brain that were more active during emotional processing than during a neutral control condition.. The meta-analyses to date predominantly focus on two theoretical approaches, locationist approaches and psychological construction approaches.
It is being debated regarding the existence of the neurobiological basis of emotion.
2010 examined 83 neuroimaging studies published between 1993-2008 to examine whether neuroimaging evidence supports the idea of biologically discrete, basic emotions (i.e.. fear, anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness).
2003 ===
Murphy, et al.. 2003 analyzed 106 peer reviewed journals published between January 1994 and December 2001 to examine the evidence for regional specialization of discrete emotions (fear, disgust, anger, happiness and sadness) across a larger set of studies that Phan et al.
Fear was consistently associated with 11 clusters (the largest activation cluster in the left amygdala) and was discriminated from the other emotion categories by significantly greater activity in the left amygdala and left putamen.. Disgust was consistently activated with 16 clusters (the largest activation cluster in the right insula/ right inferior frontal gyrus) and was discriminated from the other emotion categories by significantly greater activity in the right putamen and the left insula.


=== Lindquist et al.
Psychology Press.
Cacioppo, J.T., Tassinary, L.G., & Berntson, G.G.. (2007).
The fourth “Cognitive/ Motor Network” group included right frontal operculum, the right interior frontal gyrus, and the pre-supplementray motor area/ left interior frontal gyrus, regions that are not specific to emotion, but instead appear to play a more general role in information processing and cognitive control.. The fifth “Occipital/ Visual Association” group included areas V8 and V4 of the primary visual cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and the lateral occipital cortex, and the sixth “Medial Posterior” group included posterior cingulate cortex and area V1 of the primary visual cortex.
The insula was consistently activated in ~ 70% of studies inducing disgust, as compared to sadness (~40%), anger (~20%), fear (~20%), and happiness (~10%).. Similar to the insula, the globus pallidus was consistently activated in ~70% of studies inducing disgust, as compared to less than 25% of studies inducing sadness, fear, anger or happiness.
One version suggests the lack of a specific mode of processes, stating that the right hemisphere is solely negative emotion and the left brain is solely positive emotion.. A second version suggests that there is a complex mode of processing that occurs, specifically that there is a hemispheric specialization for the expressing and experiencing of emotion, with the right hemisphere predominating in the experiencing of both positive and negative emotion.
(2005).. Social Neuroscience.
These findings would help signify the relationship of the subcortical brain regions to the right hemisphere as having a strong connection.


==== The valence hypothesis ====
The valence hypothesis acknowledges the right hemisphere's role in emotion, but asserts that it is mainly focused on the processing of negative emotions whereas the left hemisphere processes positive emotions.. The mode of processing of the two hemispheres has been the discussion of much debate.
Lesion studies have shown that cerebellar dysfunction can attenuate the experience of positive emotions.. While these same studies do not show an attenuated response to frightening stimuli, the stimuli did not recruit structures that normally would be activated (such as the amygdala).
Disorder specific attentional biases have been found for a variety of mental disorders.. For example, participants with spider phobia show a bias to spider-related words but not other negatively valenced words.
This technique allows for direct statistical comparison between activation maps associated with each discrete emotion.. Thus, discriminability between the five discrete emotion categories was assessed on a more precise spatial scale than what had been accomplished in prior meta-analyses.
Psychological Review.. 99 (3): 554–60.
The right hemisphere is more in touch with subcortical systems of autonomic arousal and attention as demonstrated in patients that have increased spatial neglect when damage is associated to the right brain as opposed to the left brain.. Right hemisphere pathologies have also been linked with abnormal patterns of autonomic nervous system responses.
C.K.. Mills was one of the first researchers to propose a direct link between the right hemisphere and emotional processing, having observed decreased emotional processing in patients with lesions to the right hemisphere.
It may also indicate a regulatory role for the cerebellum in the neural response to rewarding stimuli, such as money, drugs of abuse, and orgasm.


=== Role of the right hemisphere in emotion ===
The right hemisphere has been proposed over time as being directly involved in the processing of emotion.. Scientific theory regarding the role of the right hemisphere has developed over time and resulted in several models of emotional functioning.
This pattern of clear discriminability between emotion categories was in fact rare, with a number of other patterns occurring in limbic regions (including amydala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and orbitofrontal cortex), paralimbic regions  (including subcallosal cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, insula, and temporal pole), and uni/heteromodal regions (including lateral prefrontal cortex, primary sensorimotor cortex, temporal cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem).. Brain regions implicated across discrete emotion included the basal ganglia (~60% of studies inducing happiness and ~60% of studies inducing disgust reported activity in this region) and medial prefrontal cortex (happiness ~60%, anger ~55%, sadness ~40%, disgust ~40%, and fear ~30%).


=== Murphy et al.
Consistency analyses identified brain regions that were associated with a given emotion.. Discriminability analyses identified brain regions that were significantly, differentially active when contrasting pairs of discrete emotions.
Strong support for the constructionist approach was defined as evidence that multiple psychological operations (some of which are not specific or selective to emotion) consistently occur across many brain regions and multiple emotional categories.
The results indicated that many brain regions demonstrated consistent and selective activations in the experience or perception of an emotion category (versus all the other emotion categories).. Consistent with constructionist models, however, no region demonstrated functional specificity for the emotions of fear, disgust, happiness, sadness or anger.

It has been identified as a main region in controlling spatial memory functions, episodic memory and executive functions.
Mammillary body – Mammillary bodies are important for  recollective memory.
Olfactory bulb – The olfactory bulbs are the first cranial nerves, located on the ventral side of the frontal lobe.. They are involved in olfaction, the perception of odors.
Cingulate gyrus – The cingulate gyrus is located above the corpus callosum and is usually considered to be part of the limbic system.
The second “Lateral Paralimbic” group included the ventral anterior insula/frontal operculum/right temporal pole/ posterior orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior insula/ posterior orbitofrontal cortex, the ventral anterior insula/ temporal cortex/ orbitofrontal cortex junction, the midinsula/ dorsal putamen, and the ventral striatum /mid insula/ left hippocampus, which the authors suggest plays a role in motivation, contributing to the general valuation of stimuli and particularly in reward.. The third “Medial Prefrontal Cortex” group included the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, and rostral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which the authors discuss as playing a role in both the generation and regulation of emotion.

Lindquist, et al.. 2012 reviewed 91 PET and fMRI studies published between January 1990 and December 2007.
For each brain region, statistical chi-squared analysis was conducted to determine if the proportion of studies reporting activation during one emotion was significantly higher than the proportion of studies reporting activation during the other emotions.. Two regions showed this statistically significant pattern across studies.
The thalamus also plays an important role in regulating  states of sleep and wakefulness.
Hypothalamus – The hypothalamus is involved in producing a physical output associated with an emotion as well as in reward circuits
Hippocampus – The hippocampus is a structure of the medial temporal lobes that is mainly involved in memory.. It works to form new memories and also connecting different senses such as visual input, smell or sound to memories.

Emotion was originally thought to be processed in the limbic system structures such as the hypothalamus and amygdala.. As of the late 1980s to early 1990s however, neocortical structures were shown to have an involvement in emotion.
In many psychological construction approaches, emotions also involve the act of interpreting one’s situation in the world relative to the internal state of the body, or what is referred to as “conceptualization.” In support of this idea, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were consistently active in this meta-analysis, regions that appear to play an important role conceptualizing during emotion, which are also involved in simulating previous experience (e.g.. knowledge, memory).
This meta-analysis examined PET or fMRI studies that reported whole brain analyses identifying significant activations for at least one of the five emotions relative to a neutral or control condition.. The authors used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to perform spatially sensitive, voxel-wise (sensitive to the spatial properties of voxels) statistical comparisons across studies.
Affective neuroscience is the study of the neural mechanisms of emotion.. This interdisciplinary field combines neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood.
2007).. Next, this neural reference space was partitioned into functional groups of brain regions showing similar activation patterns across studies by first using multivariate techniques to determine co-activation patterns and then using data-reduction techniques to define the functional groupings (resulting in six groups).
It appears to play a critical role in the regulation of emotion and behavior by anticipating the consequences of our actions.. The prefrontal cortex may play an important role in delayed gratification by maintaining emotions over time and organizing behavior toward specific goals.
Ventral striatum – The ventral striatum is a group of subcortical structures thought to play an important role in emotion and behavior.
The task is a common tool to study deficits in emotion regulation in patients with dementia, Parkinson's, and other cognitively degenerative disorders.. However, the task has also been used to analyze recognition errors in disorders such as borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.


=== Dot probe (emotion) ===
The emotional dot-probe paradigm is a task used to assess selective visual attention to and failure to detach attention from affective stimuli.
Based on the existing scientific literature, the authors proposed different roles for the brain regions that have traditionally been associated with only one emotion category.. The authors propose that the amygdala, anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex each contribute to “core affect,” which are basic feelings that are pleasant or unpleasant with some level of arousal.
One part of the ventral striatum called the nucleus accumbens is thought to be involved in the experience pleasure.. Individuals with addictions experience increased activity in this area when they encounter the object of their addiction.
Insula – The insular cortex is thought to play a critical role in the bodily experience of emotion, as it is connected to other brain structures that regulate the body’s autonomic functions (heart rate, breathing, digestion, etc.).
Oxford University Press, New York, New York.
Brain and Cognition, Vol.. 52, No.
Chi-squared analysis and density analysis both defined functionally consistent and selective regions, or regions which showed a relatively more consistent increase in activity for the experience or perception of one emotion category across studies in the literature.. Thus, a selective region could present increased activations relatively more so to one emotion category while also having a response to multiple other emotional categories.
These findings led to the development of the right hemisphere hypothesis and the valence hypothesis.


==== The right hemisphere hypothesis ====
The right hemisphere hypothesis asserts that the right hemisphere of the neocortical structures is specialized for the expression and perception of emotion.. The Right hemisphere has been linked with mental strategies that are nonverbal, synthetic, integrative, holistic, and Gestalt which makes it ideal for processing emotion.
Consistency was determined through the comparison of chi-squared analyses that revealed whether the proportion of studies reporting activation during one emotion was significantly higher than the proportion of studies reporting activation during the other emotions.. Specificity was determined through the comparison of emotion-category brain-localizations by contrasting activations in key regions that were specific to particular emotions.
The following brain structures are currently thought to be  involved in emotion:


=== Main structures of the limbic system ===
Amygdala – The amygdalae are two small, round structures located anterior to the hippocampi near the temporal poles.. The amygdalae are involved in detecting and learning what parts of our surroundings are important and have emotional significance.
Similar to Kober et al.. described above, a Multilevel Peak Kernel Density Analysis transformed the individual peak activations reported across study contrasts into a neural reference space (in other words, the set of brain regions consistently active across all study contrasts assessing emotion experience or perception).
Each basic emotion category also shares other universal characteristics: distinct facial behavior, physiology, subjective experience and accompanying thoughts and memories.


=== Psychological constructionist approaches ===
This approach to emotion hypothesizes that emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, anger and disgust (and many others) are constructed mental states that occur when many different systems in the brain work together.. In this view, networks of brain regions underlie psychological operations (e.g., language, attention, etc.) that interact to produce many different kinds of emotion, perception, and cognition.
Both meta-analyses also found that disgust was associated with increased activity in the basal ganglia, but these findings were neither consistent nor specific.. Neither consistent nor specific activity was observed across the meta-analyses for anger or for happiness.
Typical FPS paradigms involve bursts of noise or abrupt flashes of light transmitted while an individual attends to a set of stimuli.. Startle reflexes have been shown to be modulated by emotion.
For example, go/no-go studies converge with other methodology to implicate areas of the prefrontal cortex during inhibition of emotionally valenced stimuli.


=== Emotional Stroop ===
The emotional Stroop task, an adaptation to the original Stroop, measures attentional bias to emotional stimuli.. Participants must name the ink color of presented words while ignoring the words themselves.
This meta-analysis additionally introduced the concept of the basic, irreducible elements of emotional life as dimensions such as approach and avoidance.. This dimensional approach involved in psychological constructionist approaches is further examined in later meta-analyses of Kober et al.
(2009).. Emotional Expression: The Brain and The Face.
Showing a fearful facial expression when reading passages that contain fearful tones facilitates students learning of the meaning of certain vocabulary words and comprehension of the passage.


== Meta-analyses ==
A meta-analysis is a statistical approach to synthesizing results across multiple studies.. Several meta-analyses examining the brain basis of emotion have been conducted.
Similar findings have been attributed to threat words related to other anxiety disorders.. However, other studies have questioned these findings.

In general, the results supported consistency among the findings of Phan et al.. and Murphy et al., but not specificity.
However, the same region would be defined as only consistent and selective (and not specific) to fear perception if it additionally displayed increased activations during anger perception.. Strong support for the locationist approach was defined as evidence that basic emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness) consistently map onto areas of the brain that specifically activate in response to instances of only one emotional category.
The density analysis was then used to identify voxels within the neural reference space with more consistent activations for a specific emotion category (anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and disgust) than all other emotions.. Chi-squared analysis was used to create statistical maps that indicated if each previously identified and consistently active regions (those identified during density analysis) were more frequently activated in studies of each emotion category versus the average of all other emotions, regardless of activations elsewhere in the brain.
Rather, alternative limbic structures were activated, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the insula.. This may indicate that evolutionary pressure resulted in the development of the cerebellum as a redundant fear-mediating circuit to enhance survival.
Language is also central to conceptualizing, and regions that support language, including ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, were also consistently active across studies of emotion experience and perception.

One psychological operation critical for emotion is the network of brain regions that underlie valence (feeling pleasant/unpleasant) and arousal (feeling activated and energized).. Emotions emerge when neural systems underlying different psychological operations interact (not just those involved in valence and arousal), producing distributed patterns of activation across the brain.
anger ALE map; fear ALE map vs.. disgust map) across all basic emotions pairings.
The lateral orbitofrontal cortex was consistently activated in over 80% of studies inducing anger, as compared to fear (~30%), sadness (~20%), happiness (< 20%) and disgust (< 20%).. Other regions showed different patterns of activation across categories.
The increasing understanding of the role the different hemispheres play has led to increasingly complicated models, all based some way on the original valence model.


== Relationship to cognitive neuroscience ==
Despite their interactions, the study of cognition has historically excluded emotion and focused on non-emotional processes (e.g., memory, attention, perception, action, problem solving and mental imagery).. As a result, the study of the neural basis of non-emotional and emotional processes emerged as two separate fields: cognitive neuroscience and affective neuroscience.
The authors suggest that these regions play a joint role in visual processing and attention to emotional stimuli.


=== Vytal et al.. 2010 ===
Vytal, et al.
For example, healthy participants tend to show enhanced startle responses while viewing negatively valenced images and attenuated startle while viewing positively valenced images, as compared with neutral images.The startle response to a particular stimulus is greater under conditions of threat.. A common example given to indicate this phenomenon is that one’s startle response to a flash of light will be greater when walking in a dangerous neighborhood at night than it would under safer conditions.
This pattern of consistently activated, regionally specific activations was identified in four brain regions: amygdala with fear, insula with disgust, globus pallidus with disgust, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex with anger.. The amygdala was consistently activated in ~40% of studies inducing fear, as compared to less than 20% studies inducing happiness, sadness, or anger.
A specificity effect of attention has also been noted, with individuals attending selectively to threats related to their particular disorder.. For example, those with social phobia selectively attend to social threats but not physical threats.
Because emotions emerge from more basic components, there is heterogeneity within each emotion category; for example, a person can experience many different kinds of fear, which feel differently, and which correspond to different neural patterns in the brain.. Thus, this view presents a different approach to understanding the neural bases of emotion than locationist approaches.

Black and white photographs of 10 actors (6 male, 4 female) are presented, with each actor displaying each basic emotion.. Participants are usually asked to respond quickly with the name of the displayed emotion.
Consistent with a psychological construction approach to emotion, the authors discuss each functional group in terms more basic psychological operations.. The first “Core Limbic” group included the left amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray/thalamus regions, and amygdala/ventral striatum/ventral globus pallidus/thalamus regions, which the authors discuss as an integrative emotional center that plays a general role in evaluating affective significance.
Someone who is feeling sad will understand a sad passage better than someone feeling happy.. Therefore, a student’s emotion plays a big role during the learning process.
Emotion can also be embodied or perceived from words read on a page or a person’s facial expression.
Specific neural patterns were defined as architecturally separate circuits for one emotion vs.. the other emotions (for example, the fear circuit must be discriminable from the anger circuit, although both circuits may include common brain regions).
The amygdala, for example, appears to play a more general role in indicating if external sensory information is motivationally salient, and is particularly active when a stimulus is novel or evokes uncertainty.. The anterior insula may represent core affective feelings in awareness across a number of emotion categories, driven largely by sensations originating in the body.

They are critical for the production of emotion, and may be particularly so for negative emotions, especially fear.. Multiple studies have shown amygdala activation when perceiving a potential threat; various circuits allow the amygdala to use related past memories to better judge the possible threat.
Thalamus – The thalamus is involved in relaying sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex, especially visual stimuli.
This meta-analysis used multilevel kernal density analysis (MKDA) to examine fMRI and PET studies, a technique that prevents single studies from dominating the results (particularly if they report multiple nearby peaks) and that enables studies with large sample sizes (those involving more participants) to exert more influence upon the results.. MKDA was used to establish a neural reference space that includes the set of regions showing consistent increases across all studies (for further discussion of MDKA see Wager et al.
2006 examined 161 studies published between 1990-2001, subsets of which were analyzed in previous meta-analyses (Phan, et al.. 2002 and Murphy et al.
FPS is most often assessed through the magnitude of the eyeblink startle reflex, which can be measured by electromyography.. This eyeblink reflex is an automatic defensive reaction to an abrupt elicitor, making it an objective indicator of fear.
In laboratory studies, the threat of receiving shock is enough to potentiate startle, even without any actual shock.Fear potentiated startle paradigms are often used to study fear learning and extinction in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.. In fear conditioning studies, an initially neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with an aversive one, borrowing from classical conditioning.
The paradigm begins with a fixation cross at the center of a screen.. An emotional stimulus and a neutral stimulus appear side by side, after which a dot appears behind either the neutral stimulus (incongruent condition) or the affective stimulus (congruent condition).
2008 ===
Instead of investigating specific emotions, Kober, et al.. 2008 reviewed 162 neuroimaging studies published between 1990-2005 to determine if groups of brain regions show consistent patterns of activation during emotional experience (that is, actively experiencing an emotion first-hand) and during emotion perception (that is, perceiving a given emotion as experienced by another).
Sadness was consistently associated with 35 clusters (the largest activation cluster located in the left medial frontal gyrus) and was discriminated from the other emotion categories by significantly greater activity in left medial frontal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus.. Anger was consistently associated with activity in 13 clusters (the largest of which was located in the left inferior frontal gyrus), and was discriminated from the other emotion categories by significantly greater activity in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, and in right parahippocampal gyrus.
The hippocampus allows memories to be stored long term and also retrieves them when necessary.. It is this retrieval that is used within the amygdala to help evaluate current affective stimulus.
Fornix – The fornix is the main output pathway from the hippocampus to the mammillary bodies.Motor nuclei are found throughout the brainstem—medulla, pons, and midbrain—and for developmental reasons are found near the midline of the brainstem.
Generally, motor nuclei found higher in the brainstem (i.e., more rostral) innervate muscles that are higher on the face.. For example, the oculomotor nucleus contains α-MNs that innervate muscles of the eye, and is found in the midbrain, the most rostral brainstem component.
There is similar somatotopy associated with α-MNs that innervate flexor and extensor muscles: α-MNs that innervate flexors tend to be located in the dorsal portion of lamina IX; those that innervate extensors tend to be located more ventrally.


== Development ==

Alpha motor neurons originate in the basal plate, the ventral portion of the neural tube in the developing embryo.. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is secreted by the nearby notochord and other ventral structures (e.g., the floor plate), establishing a gradient of highly concentrated Shh in the basal plate and less concentrated Shh in the alar plate.
Like other regions of the spinal cord, cells in this lamina are somatotopically organized, meaning that the position of neurons within the spinal cord is associated with what muscles they innervate.. In particular, α-MNs in the medial zone of lamina IX tend to innervate proximal muscles of the body, while those in the lateral zone tend to innervate more distal muscles.
A secondary cause of muscle atrophy is that denervated muscles are no longer supplied with trophic factors from the α-MNs that innervate them.. Alpha motor neuron lesions also result in abnormal EMG potentials (e.g., fibrillation potentials) and fasciculations, the latter being spontaneous, involuntary muscle contractions.
Diseases that impair signaling between α-MNs and extrafusal muscle fibers, namely diseases of the neuromuscular junction have similar signs to those that occur with α-MN disease.
There are more α-MNs in the spinal cord than in the brainstem, as the number of α-MNs is directly proportional to the amount of fine motor control in that muscle.. For example, the muscles of a single finger have more α-MNs per fiber, and more α-MNs in total, than the muscles of the quadriceps, which allows for finer control of the force a finger applies.
In general, α-MNs on one side of the brainstem or spinal cord innervate muscles on that same side of body.
Alpha (α) motor neurons (also called alpha motoneurons), are large, multipolar lower motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord.. They innervate extrafusal muscle fibers of skeletal muscle and are directly responsible for initiating their contraction.
Those α-MNs that do not receive sufficient neurotrophic factors will undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.
Because they innervate many muscles, some clusters of α-MNs receive high concentrations of neurotrophic factors and survive this stage of neuronal pruning.. This is true of the α-MNs innervating the upper and lower limbs: these α-MNs form large cell columns that contribute to the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord.
For example, myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that prevents signaling across the neuromuscular junction, which results in functional denervation of muscle.

NIF Search - Alpha Motor Neuron via the Neuroscience Information Framework
The knee-jerk reflex is an example of such a monosynaptic reflex.
The most extensive input to α-MNs is from local interneurons, which are the most numerous type of neuron in the spinal cord.. Among their many roles, interneurons synapse on α-MNs to create more complex reflex circuitry.
Loss of involuntary control results from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex.. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in flaccid paresis.
This afferent and efferent connectivity is required to achieve coordinated muscle activity.


=== Afferent input ===
Upper motor neurons (UMNs) send input to α-MNs via several pathways, including (but not limited to) the corticonuclear, corticospinal, and rubrospinal tracts.. The corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts are commonly encountered in studies of upper and lower motor neuron connectivity in the control of voluntary movements.
The corticonuclear tract is so named because it connects the cerebral cortex to cranial nerve nuclei.
These connections provide the structure for the neural circuits that underlie reflexes.. There are several types of reflex circuits, the simplest of which consists of a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a α-MNs.
As with most types of neurons in the nervous system, α-MNs are more numerous in early development than in adulthood.. Muscle fibers secrete a limited amount of neurotrophic factors capable of sustaining only a fraction of the α-MNs that initially project to the muscle fiber.
In addition, certain diseases are associated with the selective loss of α-MNs.. For example, poliomyelitis is caused by a virus that specifically targets and kills motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.
Acetylcholine is sensed by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on extrafusal muscle fibers, causing their contraction.
Like other motor neurons, α-MNs are named after the properties of their axons.. Alpha motor neurons have Aα axons, which are large-caliber, heavily myelinated fibers that conduct action potentials  rapidly.
By contrast, gamma motor neurons have Aγ axons, which are slender, lightly  myelinated fibers that conduct less rapidly.


== Clinical significance ==

Injury to α-MNs is the most common type of lower motor neuron lesion.. Damage may be caused by trauma, ischemia, and infection, among others.
This region is designated lamina IX in the Rexed lamina system, which classifies regions of gray matter based on their cytoarchitecture.. Lamina IX is located predominantly in the medial aspect of the ventral horn, although there is some contribution to lamina IX from a collection of motor neurons located more laterally.
One type of interneuron is the Renshaw cell, discussed later.


=== Efferent output ===
Alpha motor neurons send fibers that mainly synapse on extrafusal muscle fibers.. Other fibers from α-MNs synapse on Renshaw cells, i.e.
An exception is the trochlear nucleus in the brainstem, which innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye on the opposite side of the face.


=== Brainstem ===
In the brainstem, α-MNs and other neurons reside within clusters of cells called nuclei, some of which contain the cell bodies of neurons belonging to the cranial nerves.. Not all cranial nerve nuclei contain α-MNs; those that do are motor nuclei, while others are sensory nuclei.
Under the influence of Shh and other factors, some neurons of the basal plate differentiate into α-MNs.
Like other neurons, α-MNs send axonal projections to reach their target extrafusal muscle fibers via axon guidance, a process regulated in part by neurotrophic factors released by target muscle fibers.. Neurotrophic factors also ensure that each muscle fiber is innervated by the appropriate number of α-MNs.
Alpha motor neurons receive input from a number of sources, including upper motor neurons, sensory neurons, and interneurons.. The primary output of α-MNs is to extrafusal muscle fibers.
(The corticonuclear tract is also called the corticobulbar tract, as the brainstem is sometimes called the "bulb" of the brain.) It is via this pathway that upper motor neurons from the cortex descend from the cortex and synapse on α-MNs of the brainstem.. Similarly, UMNs of the cerebral cortex are in direct control of α-MNs of the spinal cord via the lateral and ventral corticospinal tracts.
The sensory input to α-MNs is extensive and has its origin in Golgi tendon organs, muscle spindles, mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and other sensory neurons in the periphery.
Amyotropic lateral sclerosis likewise is associated with the selective loss of motor neurons.
Paralysis is one of the most pronounced effects of damage to α-MNs.. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate.
Both types of synapses rely on neurotransmitters to transduce the electrical signal into a chemical signal and back.. One way they differ is that synapses between neurons typically use glutamate or GABA as their neurotransmitters, while the neuromuscular junction uses acetylcholine exclusively.
Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing hyporeflexia.
Muscle weakness and atrophy are inevitable consequences of α-MN lesions as well.. Because muscle size and strength are related to the extent of their use, denervated muscles are prone to atrophy.
By contrast, the hypoglossal nucleus, which contains α-MNs that innervate the tongue, is found in the medulla, the most caudal (i.e., towards the bottom) of the brainstem structures.


=== Spinal cord ===

In the spinal cord, α-MNs are located within the gray matter that forms the ventral horn.. These α-MNs provide the motor component of the spinal nerves that innervate muscles of the body.

As in the brainstem, higher segments of the spinal cord contain α-MNs that innervate muscles higher on the body.World peace!. or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.
This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie love and peace.. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.Sympathetic ganglia are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.. They deliver information to the body about stress and impending danger, and are responsible for the familiar fight-or-flight response.
They contain approximately 20,000–30,000 nerve cell bodies and are located close to and on either side of the spinal cord in long chains.. Sympathetic ganglia are the tissue from which neuroblastoma tumours arise.


== Structure ==


=== Sympathetic chain ganglia ===
The bilaterally symmetric sympathetic chain ganglia, also called the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord.
The chain extends from the upper neck down to the coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.. Preganglionic nerves from the spinal cord synapse at one of the chain ganglia, and the postganglionic fiber extends to an effector, a visceral organ in the thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, or pelvic cavity.
There are usually 22-23 pairs of these ganglia:
3 in the cervical region (cervical ganglia), 11 in the thoracic region (note the presence of the stellate cervicothoracic ganglia), 4 in the lumbar region and 4-5 in the sacral region.
Throughout human evolution, the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia merged - and this resulting ganglion is called the stellate ganglion (so called because of its radiating pattern similar in appearance to a star).. 
The general rule of interaction of the nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system begins at the spinal cord.
Here they arise from the thoracolumbar (T1-L2) regions' lateral horn of grey and emerge via the ventral root.. They enter their respective spinal nerve (e.g.The work of Karl Lashley in rats for a time in the early to mid 20th century put a damper on localization theory and lesion models of behavioral function.
In the United States, the work of Norman Geschwind led to a renaissance of behavioral neurology.. He is famous for his work on disconnection syndromes, aphasia, and behavioral syndromes of limbic epilepsy, also called Geschwind syndrome.

Valenstein, Edward; Heilman, Kenneth M.. (2003).
Behavioral neurology is a subspecialty of neurology that studies the impact of neurological damage and disease upon behavior, memory, and cognition, and the treatment thereof.. Two fields associated with behavioral neurology are neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology.
In the United States, 'Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry' has been recognized as a single subspecialty by the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS) since 2004.
Behavioral neurology is that speciality of one, which deals with the study of neurological basis of behavior, memory, and cognition, and their impact of damage and disease and treatment.
Syndromes and diseases commonly studied by behavioral neurology include:


== History ==
While descriptions of behavioral syndromes go back to the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, it was during the 19th century that behavioral neurology began to arise, first with the primitive localization theories of Franz Gall, followed in the mid 19th century by the first localizations in aphasias by Paul Broca and then Carl Wernicke.. Localizationist neurology and clinical descriptions reached a peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, with work extending into the clinical descriptions of dementias by Alois Alzheimer and Arnold Pick.

Sensation and perception
Motivated behavior (hunger, thirst, sex)
Control of movement
Learning and memory
Sleep and biological rhythms
EmotionHowever, with increasing technical sophistication and with the development of more precise noninvasive methods that can be applied to human subjects, behavioral neuroscientists are beginning to contribute to other classical topic areas of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics, such as:

Language
Reasoning and decision making
ConsciousnessBehavioral neuroscience has also had a strong history of contributing to the understanding of medical disorders, including those that fall under the purview of clinical psychology and biological psychopathology (also known as abnormal psychology).. Although animal models do not exist for all mental illnesses, the field has contributed important therapeutic data on a variety of conditions, including:

Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech.
Huntington's disease, a rare inherited neurological  disorder whose most obvious symptoms are abnormal body movements and a lack of coordination.
It can monitor brain development and cognitive engagement.
Functional neuroanatomy – A more complex counterpart of phrenology.. The expression of some anatomical marker is taken to reflect neural activity.
RASSL's represent a GPCR-based chemogenetic tool.. These synthetic ligands upon activation can decrease neural function by G-protein activation.
Computational models allow researchers in psychology to enhance their understanding of the functions and developments in nervous systems.. Examples of methods include the modelling of neurons, networks and brain systems and theoretical analysis.
The recent sequencing of the genome of many species, most notably mice, has facilitated this technique.
Selective breeding – Organisms, often mice, may be bred selectively among inbred strains to create a recombinant congenic strain.. This might be done to isolate an experimentally interesting stretch of DNA derived from one strain on the background genome of another strain to allow stronger inferences about the role of that stretch of DNA.
Genetic engineering – The genome may also be experimentally-manipulated; for example, knockout mice can be engineered to lack a particular gene, or a gene may be expressed in a strain which does not normally do so (the 'transgenic').
The spiritualist and the associationist must both be 'cerebralists,' to the extent at least of admitting that certain peculiarities in the way of working of their own favorite principles are explicable only by the fact that the brain laws are a codeterminant of their result.
Our first conclusion, then, is that a certain amount of brain-physiology must be presupposed or included in Psychology.

The emergence of both psychology and behavioral neuroscience as legitimate sciences can be traced from the emergence of physiology from anatomy, particularly neuroanatomy.. Physiologists conducted experiments on living organisms, a practice that was distrusted by the dominant anatomists of the 18th and 19th centuries.
This innervation results in the amplification of γ-rhythms, which increases motor activity.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation – In some cases (for example, studies of motor cortex), this technique can be analyzed as having a stimulatory effect (rather than as a functional lesion).
Optogenetic excitation – A light activated excitatory protein is expressed in select cells.. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light activated cation channel, was the first bacterial opsin shown to excite neurons in response to light, though a number of new excitatory optogenetic tools have now been generated by improving and imparting novel properties to ChR2


=== Measuring neural activity ===
Optical techniques – Optical methods for recording neuronal activity rely on methods that modify the optical properties of neurons in response to the cellular events associated with action potentials or neurotransmitter release.
Voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) were among the earliest method for optically detecting action potentials.
This can with Potassium attenuating neural activity.
Psychopharmacological manipulations – A chemical receptor antagonist induces neural activity by interfering with neurotransmission.. Antagonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure into the ventricles or into specific brain structures.
Computational methods have a wide variety of roles including clarifying experiments, hypothesis testing and generating new insights.. These techniques play an increasing role in the advancement of biological psychology.


=== Limitations and advantages ===
Different manipulations have advantages and limitations.
Neural tissue destroyed as a primary consequence of a surgery, electric shock or neurotoxin can confound the results so that the physical trauma masks changes in the fundamental neurophysiological processes of interest.
For example, when using an electrolytic probe to create a purposeful lesion in a distinct region of the rat brain, surrounding tissue can be affected: so, a change in behavior exhibited by the experimental group post-surgery is to some degree a result of damage to surrounding neural tissue, rather than by a lesion of a distinct brain region.. Most genetic manipulation techniques are also considered permanent.
It also affects a number of mental abilities and some aspects of personality.
Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease that, in its most common form, is found in people over the age of 65 and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and by neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes.
Clinical depression, a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in usual activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure.
Schizophrenia, a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental illness characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality, most commonly manifesting as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions or disorganized speech and thinking in the context of significant social or occupational dysfunction.
Autism, a brain development disorder that impairs social interaction and communication, and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old.
Anxiety, a physiological state characterized by cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral components.. These components combine to create the feelings that are typically recognized as fear, apprehension, or worry.
Drug abuse, including alcoholism.

Nobel Laureates
The following Nobel Prize winners could reasonably be considered behavioral neuroscientists or neurobiologists.
The term "psychobiology" was  first used in its modern sense by Knight Dunlap in his book An Outline of Psychobiology (1914).. Dunlap also was the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal Psychobiology.
The influential work of Claude Bernard, Charles Bell, and William Harvey helped to convince the scientific community that reliable data could be obtained from living subjects.
Even before the 18th and 19th century, behavioral neuroscience was beginning to take form as far back as 1700 B.C.. The question that seems to continually arise is what is the connection between the mind and body.
Physiological psychology is a subfield of behavioral neuroscience, with an appropriately narrower definition


== Research methods ==
The distinguishing characteristic of a behavioral neuroscience experiment is that either the independent variable of the experiment is biological, or some dependent variable is biological.. In other words, the nervous system of the organism under study is permanently or temporarily altered, or some aspect of the nervous system is measured (usually to be related to a behavioral variable).


=== Disabling or decreasing neural function ===
Lesions – A classic method in which a brain-region of interest is naturally or intentionally destroyed to observe any resulting changes such as degraded or enhanced performance on some behavioral measure.
This technique uses different types of electrodes for recording systems such as needle electrodes and saline-based electrodes.. EEG allows for the investigation of mental disorders, sleep disorders and physiology.
Research on localization of function has led behavioral neuroscientist to a better understanding of which parts of the brain control behavior.. This is best exemplified through the case study of Phineas Gage.
The term "psychobiology" has been used in a variety of contexts, emphasizing the importance of biology, which is the discipline that studies organic, neural and cellular modifications in behavior, plasticity in neuroscience, and biological diseases in all aspects, in addition, biology focuses and analyzes behavior and all the subjects it is concerned about, from a scientific point of view.
Plato and Aristotle are two of several philosophers who participated in this debate.. Plato believed that the brain was where all mental thought and processes happened.
As a result of localization of function research, many famous people found within psychology have come to various different conclusions.. Wilder Penfield was able to develop a map of the cerebral cortex through studying epileptic patients along with Rassmussen.
In this context, psychology helps as a complementary, but important discipline in the neurobiological sciences.. The role of psychology in this questions is that of a social tool that backs up the main or strongest biological science.
This theory was inspired by moving statues in a garden in Paris.Other philosophers also helped give birth to psychology.. One of the earliest textbooks in the new field, The Principles of Psychology by William James, argues that the scientific study of psychology should be grounded in an understanding of biology:

Bodily experiences, therefore, and more particularly brain-experiences, must take a place amongst those conditions of the mental life of which Psychology need take account.
VSDs commonly become fluorescent in response to a neuron's change in voltage, rendering individual action potentials detectable.. Genetically encoded voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins have also been developed.
Calcium imaging relies on dyes or genetically encoded proteins that fluoresce upon binding to the calcium that is transiently present during an action potential.
Synapto-pHluorin is a technique that relies on a fusion protein that combines a synaptic vesicle membrane protein and a pH sensitive fluorescent protein.
Behavioral neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, biopsychology, or psychobiology is the application of the principles of biology to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior in humans and other animals.


== History ==
Behavioral neuroscience as a scientific discipline emerged from a variety of scientific and philosophical traditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.. In philosophy, people like René Descartes proposed physical models to explain animal and human behavior.
For example, the expression of immediate early genes is thought to be caused by vigorous neural activity.. Likewise, the injection of 2-deoxyglucose prior to some behavioral task can be followed by anatomical localization of that chemical; it is taken up by neurons that are electrically active.
MEG – Magnetoencephalography shows the functioning of the human brain through the measurement of electromagnetic activity.
This allies behavioral neuroscience closely with comparative psychology, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, and neurobiology.. Behavioral neuroscience also has paradigmatic and methodological similarities to neuropsychology, which relies heavily on the study of the behavior of humans with nervous system dysfunction (i.e., a non-experimentally based biological manipulation).
Synonyms for behavioral neuroscience include biopsychology, biological psychology, and psychobiology.
(This list omits winners who were almost exclusively neuroanatomists or neurophysiologists; i.e., those that did not measure behavioral or neurobiological variables.)

Bacterial Halorhodopsins or Proton pumps are the two classes of proteins used for inhibitory optogenetics, achieving inhibition by increasing cytoplasmic levels of halides (Cl−) or decreasing the cytoplasmic concentration of protons, respectively.


=== Enhancing neural function ===
Electrical stimulation – A classic method in which neural activity is enhanced by application of a small electric current (too small to cause significant cell death).
Psychopharmacological manipulations – A chemical receptor agonist facilitates neural activity by enhancing or replacing endogenous neurotransmitters.. Agonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure.
Synthetic Ligand Injection – Likewise, Gq-DREADDs can be used to modulate cellular function by innervation of brain regions such as Hippocampus.
In contrast, Aristotle believed that the brain served the purpose of cooling down the emotions derived from the heart.. The mind-body problem was a stepping stone toward attempting to understand the connection between the mind and body.
Another debate arose about was localization of function or functional specialization versus equipotentiality which played a significant role in the development in behavioral neuroscience.
In the announcement of that journal, Dunlap writes that the journal will publish research "...bearing on the interconnection of mental and physiological functions", which describes the field of behavioral neuroscience even in its modern sense.


== Relationship to other fields of psychology and biology ==
In many cases, humans may serve as experimental subjects in behavioral neuroscience experiments; however, a great deal of the experimental literature in behavioral neuroscience comes from the study of non-human species, most frequently rats, mice, and monkeys.. As a result, a critical assumption in behavioral neuroscience is that organisms share biological and behavioral similarities, enough to permit extrapolations across species.
Advanced techniques may also permit the expression or suppression of a gene to occur by injection of some regulating chemical.


== Other research methods ==
Computational models - Using a computer to formulate real-world problems to develop solutions.. Although this method is often focused in computer science, it has begun to move towards other areas of study.For example, psychology is one of these areas.
These particles are emitted by injections of radioisotopes such as fluorine.. PET imaging reveal the pathological processes which predict anatomic changes making it important for detecting, diagnosing and characterising many pathologies
Electroencephalography – Or EEG; and the derivative technique of event-related potentials, in which scalp electrodes monitor the average activity of neurons in the cortex (again, used most frequently with human subjects).
