Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans.. This ramus then enters the spinal nerve and is sent to its synapsing target, or becomes a visceral branch to enter a plexus (e.g.
the superficial or deep cardiac plexuses), or synapses directly onto a target.


=== Collateral ganglia ===
Neurons of the collateral ganglia, also called the prevertebral ganglia, receive input from the splanchnic nerves and innervate organs of the abdominal and pelvic region.. These include the celiac ganglia, superior mesenteric ganglia, and inferior mesenteric ganglia.

thoraxlesson5 at The Anatomy Lesson by Wesley Norman (Georgetown University) (paravertebralregion)Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects.. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.There are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function.
The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles.. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well.
The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure.. The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals.
The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning.. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance.
It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains.. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.
The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming.. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord.
And by the same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and terrors assail us, some by night, and some by day, and dreams and untimely wanderings, and cares that are not suitable, and ignorance of present circumstances, desuetude, and unskillfulness.. All these things we endure from the brain, when it is not healthy...
On the Sacred Disease, attributed to Hippocrates

The Roman physician Galen also argued for the importance of the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work.
The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal.. Arthropods have a central brain, the supraesophageal ganglion, with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing.
The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods of PET, fMRI, and NIRS.. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.


== Functions ==

Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain.
The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved.. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.
The sea slug Aplysia californica was chosen by Nobel Prize-winning neurophysiologist Eric Kandel as a model for studying the cellular basis of learning and memory, because of the simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system, and it has been examined in hundreds of experiments.


==== Vertebrates ====

The first vertebrates appeared over 500 million years ago (Mya), during the Cambrian period, and may have resembled the modern hagfish in form.
In other animals additional senses are present, such as the infrared heat-sense of snakes, the magnetic field sense of some birds, or the electric field sense of some types of fish.
Each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear.. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality.
Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of René Descartes and those who followed him.. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms.
On one hand, it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity; such simulations are known as biologically realistic neural networks.. On the other hand, it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating, or mathematically analyzing, the operations of simplified "units" that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity.
So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources.. However, the Human Brain Project is trying to build a realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain.ISBN 978-0-87893-695-3.

At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.The basal ganglia, also called basal nuclei, are a set of structures deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation.. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus.
Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion.. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation.
This dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of the brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission, and subsequent cognitive decline and disease.


== Clinical significance ==


=== General ===
Brain damage or injury to the brain can manifest in many ways.. Traumatic brain injury, for example received in contact sport, after a fall, or a traffic or work accident, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems.
Akio Mori coined the term game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.Historically, the brain featured in popular culture through phrenology, a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to different regions of the cortex.. The cortex remains important in popular culture as covered in books and satire.
Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus.. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex.
The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.

The cerebrum contains the ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated.. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane that separates the lateral ventricles.
Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths.. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, during the time of the Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs.
From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.The sense of smell is generated by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity.. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve.
Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production.. Korbinian Brodmann divided regions of the brain based on the appearance of cells.
A number of techniques are used to study the brain.. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information.
The brainstem consists of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata.. The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts.
He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid.. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.Thomas Willis is considered a second pioneer in the study of neurology and brain science.
The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves.. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.René Descartes proposed the theory of dualism to tackle the issue of the brain's relation to the mind.
As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain.. MRI scans, not as widely available, may be able to demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.Having experienced a stroke, a person may be admitted to a stroke unit, and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes, including ongoing anticoagulation (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs.
Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.Blood from here drains into the left and right transverse sinuses.. These then drain into the sigmoid sinuses, which receive blood from the cavernous sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses.
Resting state fMRI
looks at the interaction of brain regions whilst the brain is not performing a specific task.. This is also used to show the default mode network.
Any electrical current generates a magnetic field; neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields, and in functional magnetoencephalography the current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution.
The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon.. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons.
The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four.. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.

Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.. At the deepest part of the lateral sulcus between the insular cortex and the striatum is a thin neuronal sheet called the claustrum.
The cerebellum rests at the back of the cranial cavity, lying beneath the occipital lobes, and is separated from these by the cerebellar tentorium, a sheet of fibre.It is connected to the midbrain of the brainstem by the superior cerebellar peduncles, to the pons by the middle cerebellar peduncles, and to the medulla by the inferior cerebellar peduncles.. The cerebellum consists of an inner medulla of white matter and an outer cortex of richly folded grey matter.Glial cells, such as astroglia and microglia, as well as endothelial cells, could be included in an artificial neural network.. This would enable modeling of diseases where pathological effects may occur from sources other than neurons, such as Alzheimer's disease.


== Factors affecting choice of artificial neural network ==
While the term artificial neural network is usually used in computational neurogenetic modeling to refer to models of the central nervous system meant to possess biological accuracy, the general use of the term can be applied to many gene regulatory networks as well.


=== Time variance ===
Artificial neural networks, depending on type, may or may not take into account the timing of inputs.
Unsupervised learning is the learning mechanism by which a type of artificial neural network known as a self-organizing map (SOM) learns.. Some types of artificial neural network, such as evolving connectionist systems, can learn in both a supervised and unsupervised manner.


== Improvement ==
Both gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks have two main strategies for improving their accuracy.PMID 12991237.

There are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits in these areas may carry out biologically relevant computation.The brain seems to be able to discriminate and adapt particularly well in certain contexts.. For instance, human beings seem to have an enormous capacity for memorizing and recognizing faces.
Hubel & Wiesel discovered that neurons in the primary visual cortex, the first cortical area to process information coming from the retina, have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns.. David Marr's work focused on the interactions between neurons, suggesting computational approaches to the study of how functional groups of neurons within the hippocampus and neocortex interact, store, process, and transmit information.Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans.. This ramus then enters the spinal nerve and is sent to its synapsing target, or becomes a visceral branch to enter a plexus (e.g.
the superficial or deep cardiac plexuses), or synapses directly onto a target.

According to ancient authorities, "he believed the seat of sensations is in the brain.
He described in great detail the structure of the brainstem, the cerebellum, the ventricles, and the cerebral hemispheres.


== Modern period ==

The role of electricity in nerves was first observed in dissected frogs by Luigi Galvani in the second half of the 18th century.. In the 1820s, Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of carrying out localized lesions of the brain in animals describing their effects on motricity, sensibility and behavior.Yates is Professor of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.The Journal of Neurophysiology publishes original articles on the function of the nervous system.. All levels of function are included, from membrane biophysics to cell biology to systems neuroscience and the experimental analysis of behavior.Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans..

Some databases contain descriptive and numerical data, some to brain function, others offer access to 'raw' imaging data, such as postmortem brain sections or 3D MRI and fMRI images.The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found within the motor end plate.. Once two acetylcholine receptors have been bound, an ion channel is opened and sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell.
They are also called red fibers.
Fast fatiguing (FF) motor units stimulate larger muscle groups, which apply large amounts of force but fatigue very quickly.. They are used for tasks that require large brief bursts on energy, such as jumping or running.

F.. Dubach (2003).However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy.


=== Cell staining ===
In biological systems, staining is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images.
Nissl staining uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which is abundant in neurons.. This allows researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system cytoarchitecture.
The classic Golgi stain uses potassium dichromate and silver nitrate to fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle any cells can react similarly).
The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated.. The mouse is used because, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a six-layered cortex, yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast).


=== Caenorhabditis elegans ===

The brain is small and simple in some species, such as the  nematode worm, where the body plan is quite simple: a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain.
This resulted in a boom of research in neuroanatomy by artists and scientists of the Renaissance.In 1664, Thomas Willis, a physician and professor at Oxford University, coined the term neurology when he published his text Cerebri anatome which is considered the foundation of neuroanatomy.. The subsequent three hundred and fifty some years has produced a great deal of documentation and study of the neural systems.


== Composition ==
At the tissue level, the nervous system is composed of neurons, glial cells, and extracellular matrix.
The term sagittal refers etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, because it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (sagitta; arrow in Latin).
A section plane across any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse if it is orthogonal to the axis (e.g., a transverse section of a finger; if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities).. Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, that represents the body axis both in animals and man.Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans.. This ramus then enters the spinal nerve and is sent to its synapsing target, or becomes a visceral branch to enter a plexus (e.g.
the superficial or deep cardiac plexuses), or synapses directly onto a target.

Following RGC proliferation, neurogenesis involves a final cell division of the parent RGC, which produces one of two possible outcomes.The hosts are then screened with the aid of a toxic drug that the selectable marker is resistant to.. The use of recombinant DNA is an example of a reverse genetics, where researchers create a mutant genotype and analyze the resulting phenotype.
The current areas of research are very diverse in their focuses.. One area deals with molecular processes and the function of certain proteins, often in conjunction with cell signaling and neurotransmitter release, cell development and repair, or neuronal plasticity.
These are just a few examples of what current research in the field of neurogenetics has achieved.

Tanycytes in the median eminence of the hypothalamus are a type of ependymal cell that descend from radial glia and line the base of the third ventricle.


=== Total number ===
In general, neuroglial cells are smaller than neurons.. There are approximately 85 billion glia cells in the human brain, about the same number as neurons.
But now, there is direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses.. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.

Neuron.. 60 (3): 430–40.A CT scan can be performed in under a second and produce rapid results for clinicians, with its ease of use leading to an increase in CT scans performed in the United States from 3 million in 1980 to 62 million in 2007.. Clinicians oftentimes take multiple scans, with 30% of individuals undergoing at least 3 scans in one study of CT scan usage.
Tomographic reconstruction, (mainly used for functional "snapshots" of the brain) requires multiple projections from Detector Heads which rotate around the human skull, so some researchers have developed 6 and 11 Detector Head SPECT machines to cut imaging time and give higher resolution.Like PET, SPECT also can be used to differentiate different kinds of disease processes which produce dementia, and it is increasingly used for this purpose.. Neuro-PET has a disadvantage of requiring the use of tracers with half-lives of at most 110 minutes, such as FDG.
Scientists soon learned that the large blood flow changes measured by PET could also be imaged by the correct type of MRI.. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was born, and
since the 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate the brain mapping field due to its low invasiveness, lack of radiation exposure, and relatively wide availability.
In the early 2000s, the field of neuroimaging reached the stage where limited practical applications of functional brain imaging have become feasible.

There are also conditions viewed as neurological where a person appears to consciously register neurological stimuli that cannot possibly be coming from the part of the nervous system to which they would normally be attributed, such as phantom pain or synesthesia, or where limbs act without conscious direction, as in alien hand syndrome.In some countries, additional legal responsibilities of a neurologist may include making a finding of brain death when it is suspected that a patient has died..

thoraxlesson5 at The Anatomy Lesson by Wesley Norman (Georgetown University) (paravertebralregion)For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light.. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate.
Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometers and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex "dendritic tree".. An axon (also called a nerve fiber) is a special cellular extension (process) that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species.
Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.


=== Demyelination ===

Demyelination is the act of demyelinating, or the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves.
This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where to get greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) there have to be more photons, as the photons can't become "stronger" for a specific frequency.
There are a number of other receptor types that are called quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with steady stimulus; examples include: skin when touched by an object causes the neurons to fire, but if the object maintains even pressure against the skin, the neurons stop firing.. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.
The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure.
Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites; signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon.. A typical synapse, then, is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another.
For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.
The soma is the body of the neuron.. As it contains the nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here.
This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.
Neurons communicate by chemical and electrical synapses in a process known as neurotransmission, also called synaptic transmission.. The fundamental process that triggers the release of neurotransmitters is the action potential, a propagating electrical signal that is generated by exploiting the electrically excitable membrane of the neuron.
The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and longer in the CNS.. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are currently unknown.


== Neurogenesis ==

Neurons are born through the process of neurogenesis, in which neural stem cells divide to produce differentiated neurons.
Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate), inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate), or modulatory (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).
The two most common neurotransmitters in the brain, glutamate and GABA, have actions that are largely consistent.. Glutamate acts on several different types of receptors, and have effects that are excitatory at ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors.Encyclopedia.com..

In 1542, the term physiology was used for the first time by a French physician named Jean Fernel, to explain bodily function in relation to the brain.. In 1543, Andreas Vesalius wrote De humani corporis fabrica, which revolutionized the study of anatomy.
He mistakenly believed that it was the "soul" of the brain, and believed it was where thoughts formed.. In 1658, Johann Jakob Wepfer studied a patient in which he believed that a broken blood vessel had caused apoplexy, or a stroke.
In 1749, David Hartley published Observations on Man, which focused on frame (neurology), duty (moral psychology) and expectations (spirituality) and how these integrated within one another.

For example, basic leg coordination of walking was normal, whereas speed, activity, and turning were affected.
In one study comparing chimpanzee and human frontopolar cortex and the frontoinsular cortex neuropil, it was found that humans exhibit a significantly higher neuropil fraction than the other areas of their brain.. This suggests that as we evolved our prefrontal cortex developed denser neuropil which translates to more neural connections.
Neuropil (or "neuropile") is any area in the nervous system composed of mostly unmyelinated axons, dendrites and glial cell processes that forms a synaptically dense region containing a relatively low number of cell bodies.. The most prevalent anatomical region of neuropil is the brain which, although not completely composed of neuropil, does have the largest and highest synaptically-concentrated areas of neuropil in the body.A systematic meta-analytic review  found that "There is no evidence from the analysis carried out that Fast ForWord is effective as a treatment for children's oral language or reading difficulties".
A 2016 review found very little evidence supporting any of the claims of Fast ForWord and other commercial products, as their task-specific effects fail to generalise to other tasks.

There is solid evidence that neurogenesis (birth of brain cells) occurs in the adult, mammalian brain—and such changes can persist well into old age.. The evidence for neurogenesis is mainly restricted to the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, but current research has revealed that other parts of the brain, including the cerebellum, may be involved as well.
However a child's brain can cope with these adverse effects through the actions of neuroplasticity.

In a single lifespan, individuals of an animal species may encounter various changes in brain morphology.. Many of these differences are caused by the release of hormones in the brain; others are the product of evolutionary factors or developmental stages.

Additionally, chronic pain has been reported to significantly reduce the volume of grey matter in the brain globally, and more specifically at the prefrontal cortex and right thalamus.. However, following treatment, these abnormalities in cortical reorganization and grey matter volume are resolved, as well as their symptoms.

Consequently, in prelingually deaf children, early cochlear implantation, as a rule, allows the children to learn the mother language and acquire acoustic communication.


=== Phantom limbs ===

In the phenomenon of phantom limb sensation, a person continues to feel pain or sensation within a part of their body that has been amputated.. This is strangely common, occurring in 60–80% of amputees.Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans.. This ramus then enters the spinal nerve and is sent to its synapsing target, or becomes a visceral branch to enter a plexus (e.g.
the superficial or deep cardiac plexuses), or synapses directly onto a target.


=== Collateral ganglia ===
Neurons of the collateral ganglia, also called the prevertebral ganglia, receive input from the splanchnic nerves and innervate organs of the abdominal and pelvic region.. These include the celiac ganglia, superior mesenteric ganglia, and inferior mesenteric ganglia.

thoraxlesson5 at The Anatomy Lesson by Wesley Norman (Georgetown University) (paravertebralregion)The majority of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes belonging to the human genome are expressed specifically in the brain.. Due to the plasticity of the human brain, the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life.
These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke, and their medical treatment.
At the time, Broca's findings were seen as a confirmation of Franz Joseph Gall's theory that language was localized and that certain psychological functions were localized in specific areas of the cerebral cortex.. The localization of function hypothesis was supported by observations of epileptic patients conducted by John Hughlings Jackson, who correctly inferred the organization of the motor cortex by watching the progression of seizures through the body.It activates skeletal muscles in the somatic nervous system and may either excite or inhibit internal organs in the autonomic system.. It is distinguished as the transmitter at the neuromuscular junction connecting motor nerves to muscles.
Nevertheless, in some cases a peptide is the primary transmitter at a synapse.. β-endorphin is a relatively well-known example of a peptide neurotransmitter because it engages in highly specific interactions with opioid receptors in the central nervous system.
Single ions (such as synaptically released zinc) are also considered neurotransmitters by some, as well as some gaseous molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).
Though widely popularized, this theory was not borne out in subsequent research.. Furthermore, problems with producing or using glutamate have been suggestively and tentatively linked to many mental disorders, including autism, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and depression.


== Neurotransmitter imbalance ==
Generally, there are no scientifically established "norms" for appropriate levels or "balances" of different neurotransmitters.
Irreversible antagonists may even form covalent chemical bonds with the receptor.. In either case, if the concentration of the irreversible antagonist is high enough, the number of unbound receptors remaining for agonist binding may be so low that even high concentrations of the agonist do not produce the maximum biological response.


=== Precursors ===
While intake of neurotransmitter precursors does increase neurotransmitter synthesis, evidence is mixed as to whether neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic receptor firing is increased.
In neurons, an agonist drug may activate neurotransmitter receptors either directly or indirectly.. Direct-binding agonists can be further characterized as full agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists.Direct agonists act similar to a neurotransmitter by binding directly to its associated receptor site(s), which may be located on the presynaptic neuron or postsynaptic neuron, or both.
The most common is called Atropine.
Indirect-acting antagonist- drugs that inhibit the release/production of neurotransmitters (e.g., Reserpine).


==== Drug antagonists ====
An antagonist drug is one that attaches (or binds) to a site called a receptor without activating that receptor to produce a biological response.. It is therefore said to have no intrinsic activity.Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans..

=== Systems neuroscience ===
Systems neuroscience is a subdiscipline of neuroscience which studies the function of neural circuits and systems.. It is an umbrella term, encompassing a number of areas of study concerned with how nerve cells behave when connected together to form neural networks.

Neural oscillation


=== Molecular neuroscience ===
Molecular neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience that examines the biology of the nervous system with molecular biology, molecular genetics, protein chemistry and related methodologies.

Nutritional neuroscience
Neurochemistry


=== Computational neuroscience ===
Computational neuroscience includes both the study of the information processing functions of the nervous system, and the use of digital computers to study the nervous system.Some authors hold that it largely contributes to the mammalian hippocampal allocortical and parahippocampal mesocortical (transitional) areas.. Others postulate it directly transforms into the six-layered isocortex (neocortex) characteristic of mammals, and still others suppose that medial and lateral parts of the dorsal pallium contribute (perhaps with some contributions from the lateral pallium) to the alternative allocortical and isocortical fates.


== In humans ==
The human pallium (cloak in Latin) envelops most of the telencephalon, due to extensive surface expansion of the isocortex.Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans..

thoraxlesson5 at The Anatomy Lesson by Wesley Norman (Georgetown University) (paravertebralregion)It may be particularly important with regard to conscious, subjective emotional awareness.. This region of the brain may also play an important role in the initiation of motivated behavior.
The existence of so-called 'basic emotions' and their defining attributes represents a long lasting and yet unsettled issue in psychology.. The available research suggests that the neurobiological existence of basic emotions is still tenable and heuristically seminal, pending some reformulation.


=== Locationist approaches ===
These approaches to emotion hypothesize that several emotion categories (including happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust) are biologically basic.
2002 ===
In the first neuroimaging meta-analysis of emotion, Phan et al.. (2002) analyzed the results of 55 studies published in peer reviewed journal articles between January 1990 and December 2000 to determine if the emotions of fear, sadness, disgust, anger, and happiness were consistently associated with activity in specific brain regions.
The orbitofrontal cortex appears to function as a site for integrating sensory information from the body and sensory information from the world to guide behavior.. Closely related to core affect, the authors propose that anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex play vital roles in attention, with anterior cingulate supporting the use of sensory information for directing attention and motor responses during response selection and with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supporting executive attention.
The insula is implicated in empathy and awareness of emotion.
Cerebellum – Recently, there has been a considerable amount of work that describes the role of the cerebellum in emotion as well as cognition, and a "Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome" has been described.. Both neuroimaging studies as well as studies following pathological lesions in the cerebellum (such as a stroke) demonstrate that the cerebellum has a significant role in emotional regulation.
More recently, the frontal lobe has been the focus of a large amount of research, stating that the frontal lobes of both hemispheres are involved in the emotional state, while the right posterior hemisphere, the parietal and temporal lobes, is involved in the processing of emotion.. Decreased right parietal lobe activity has been associated with depression and increased right parietal lobe activity with anxiety arousal.
1, pp.. 1–133 (June, 2003).
MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures.. Research has shown that limbic structures are directly related to emotion, but non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.
The different parts of the cingulate gyrus have different functions, and are involved with affect, visceromotor control, response selection, skeletomotor control, visuospatial processing, and in memory access.. A part of the cingulate gyrus is the anterior cingulate cortex, that is thought to play a central role in attention and behaviorally demanding cognitive tasks.
All studies used fMRI or PET techniques to investigate higher-order mental processing of emotion (studies of low-order sensory or motor processes were excluded).. The authors’ analysis approach was to tabulate the number of studies that reported activation in specific brain regions during tasks inducing fear, sadness, disgust, anger, and happiness.
Thus, it is possible to discern which object the participant was attending to by subtracting the reaction time to respond to congruent versus incongruent trials.The best documented research with the dot probe paradigm involves attention to threat related stimuli, such as fearful faces, in individuals with anxiety disorders.. Anxious individuals tend to respond more quickly to congruent trials, which may indicate vigilance to threat and/or failure to detach attention from threatening stimuli.Alpha motor neurons are distinct from gamma motor neurons, which innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles.
While their cell bodies are found in the central nervous system (CNS), α motor neurons are also considered part of the somatic nervous system—a branch of the peripheral nervous system (PNS)—because their axons extend into the periphery to innervate skeletal muscles.
An alpha motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates is a motor unit.. A motor neuron pool contains the cell bodies of all the alpha motor neurons involved in contracting a single muscle.


== Location ==
Alpha motor neurons (α-MNs) innervating the head and neck are found in the brainstem; the remaining α-MNs innervate the rest of the body and are found in the spinal cord.
inhibitory interneurons that synapse on the α-MN and limit its activity in order to prevent muscle damage.


== Signaling ==
Like other neurons, α-MNs transmit signals as action potentials, rapid changes in electrical activity that propagate from the cell body to the end of the axon.. To increase the speed at which action potentials travel, α-MN axons have large diameters and are heavily myelinated by both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells.Peace is the concept of harmonious well-being and freedom from hostile aggression.There is still a myelin sheath present - just in far lower amounts compared to the white ramus communicans..

The advent of in vivo neuroimaging starting in the 1980s led to a further strengthening of interest in the cognitive neurosciences and provided a tool that allowed for lesion, structural, and functional correlations with behavioral dysfunction in living people.
