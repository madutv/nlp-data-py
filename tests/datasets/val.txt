Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed.. Several of these are listed below.T5), and thus enter the white ramus communicans.. This myelinated division can then enter the sympathetic chain.

Here four options are available to the fibres: (1) they can run up the chain and synapse, (2) they can synapse at the level of entry, (3) they can pass straight through and synapse elsewhere - such as in the case of T5-12 (the splanchnic nerves), or (4) they can enter the chain and descend to synapse.. It is this ability to move superiorly and inferiorly along the chain that results in the mass response to the sympathetic nervous system.
A preganglionic fibre may synapse to 15-20 postganglionic fibres.. 
Upon exiting the sympathetic chain, the fibres enter a less-myelinated gray ramus communicans.In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.The brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue.. Living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color.
The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center.. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.
Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM.. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized.
In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons.. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer.
It is a major brain component in many vertebrates, but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell).


==== Mammals ====
The most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size.. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.Size, however, is not the only difference: there are also substantial differences in shape.
Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does.. In some respects, all that matters is the presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development.
However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates.. There is evidence that this part of the brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.
The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected structures in the forebrain.
These studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity.. Reflecting the new understanding, in 1942 Charles Sherrington visualized the workings of the brain waking from sleep:

The great topmost sheet of the mass, that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved, becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither.
The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures.. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.

Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas.
Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking.. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days.
Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.
The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics.. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development.
In many parts of the brain, axons initially "overgrow", and then are "pruned" by mechanisms that depend on neural activity.. In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point on the surface of the retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer.
Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain.. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons.
Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.
—Sherrington, 1942, Man on his Nature
The invention of electronic computers in the 1940s, along with the development of mathematical information theory, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems.. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience.
Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.


=== Metabolism ===
All vertebrates have a blood–brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body.. Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons, including levels of ions and nutrients.Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals.Also in the fifth century BC in Athens, the unknown author of On the Sacred Disease, a medical treatise which is part of the Hippocratic Corpus and traditionally attributed to Hippocrates, believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence.. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood.
A multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists plays a large role in supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation.. A history of stroke increases the risk of developing dementia by around 70%, and recent stroke increases the risk by around 120%.


=== Brain death ===

Brain death refers to an irreversible total loss of brain function.
It is constantly being regenerated and absorbed, and replaces about once every 5–6 hours.In other parts of the body, circulation in the lymphatic system clears extracellular waste products from the cell tissue.. For the tissue of the brain, such a system has not yet been identified.
The brain has two main networks of veins: an exterior or superficial network, on the surface of the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network.. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins.

Mast cells in the central nervous system are present in the meninges; they mediate neuroimmune responses in inflammatory conditions and help to maintain the blood–brain barrier, particularly in brain regions where the barrier is absent.. Across systems, mast cells serve as the main effector cell through which pathogens can affect the gut–brain axis.Some 400 genes are shown to be brain-specific.
The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH.. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed on the walls of arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies.
This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, used in the study of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function.. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution.
The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound).. This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve.
Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and to the front and below this is the hypothalamus.. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland.
Neuroscience (5th ed.).. Sunderland, Ma.: Sinauer associates.

The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain.. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres.
The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other mammals.. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than smaller mammals such as the rat and the cat.As a primate brain, the human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex, in proportion to body size, than most mammals, and a highly developed visual system.As a hominid brain, the human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to the brain of a typical monkey.

It explores how the brain gives rise to culture, and how culture influences brain development.. Cultural differences and their relation to brain development and structure are researched in different fields.


=== The mind ===

The philosophy of the mind studies such issues as the problem of understanding consciousness and the mind–body problem.
The brain features in science fiction, with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs (beings with features like partly artificial brains).. The 1942 science fiction book (adapted three times for cinema) Donovan's Brain tells the tale of an isolated brain kept alive in vitro, gradually taken over by a malign intelligence.


== History ==


=== Early history ===

The Edwin Smith Papyrus, an ancient Egyptian medical treatise written in the 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain.
These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and along the top of the cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes.. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.


==== Blood drainage ====
Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated blood from the brain.
Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.


=== Sensory ===

The sensory nervous system is involved with the reception and processing of sensory information.. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood.
The largest part of the cerebral cortex is the neocortex, which has six neuronal layers.. The rest of the cortex is of allocortex, which has three or four layers.
These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain.. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.


==== Cerebellum ====

The cerebellum is divided into an anterior lobe, a posterior lobe, and the flocculonodular lobe.
This difficulty was expressed by Gottfried Leibniz in the analogy known as Leibniz's Mill:

One is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles, that is, by figures and motions.. In imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think, to sense, and to have perception, one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions, so that one could enter into it, just like into a windmill.
Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns.. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.
At any one time, there is about 150mL of cerebrospinal fluid – most within the subarachnoid space.Ion channels, which are vital to the propagation of action potentials, are another molecule that may be modeled to more accurately reflect biological processes.. For instance, to accurately model synaptic plasticity (the strengthening or weakening of synapses) and memory, it is necessary to model the activity of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR).
An example of an artificial neural network that uses supervised learning is a multilayer perceptron (MLP).. In unsupervised learning, an artificial neural network is trained using only inputs.
The weights (and in some networks, frequencies of synaptic transmission to the node), and the resulting membrane potential of the node (including whether an action potential is produced or not), affect the expression of different genes in the gene regulatory network.. Factors affecting connections between neurons, such as synaptic plasticity, can be modeled by inputting the values of synaptic activity-associated genes and proteins to a function that re-evaluates the weight of an input from a particular neuron in the artificial neural network.


=== Incorporation of other cell types ===
Other cell types besides neurons can be modeled as well.These connections are, unlike most artificial neural networks, sparse and usually specific.. It is not known how information is transmitted through such sparsely connected networks, although specific areas of the brain, such as the Visual cortex, are understood in some detail.
Hodgkin and Huxley's original model only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse under certain conditions through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium.. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict a number of important features such as adaptation and shunting.
Computational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is a branch of neuroscience which employs mathematical models, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.Computational neuroscience focuses on the description of biologically plausible neurons (and neural systems) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not concerned with biologically unrealistic disciplines such as connectionism, machine learning, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence and computational learning theory.In theory, computational neuroscience would be a sub-field of theoretical neuroscience which employs computational simulations to validate and solve the mathematical models.. However, since the biologically plausible mathematical models formulated in neuroscience are in most cases too complex to be solved analytically, the two terms are essentially synonyms and are used interchangeably.

How do axons know where to target and how to reach these targets?. How do neurons migrate to the proper position in the central and peripheral systems?
Models of working memory, relying on theories of network oscillations and persistent activity, have been built to capture some features of the prefrontal cortex in context-related memory.One of the major problems in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales.. Unstable synapses are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption.Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed.. Several of these are listed below.T5), and thus enter the white ramus communicans.. This myelinated division can then enter the sympathetic chain.

Here four options are available to the fibres: (1) they can run up the chain and synapse, (2) they can synapse at the level of entry, (3) they can pass straight through and synapse elsewhere - such as in the case of T5-12 (the splanchnic nerves), or (4) they can enter the chain and descend to synapse.. It is this ability to move superiorly and inferiorly along the chain that results in the mass response to the sympathetic nervous system.
A preganglionic fibre may synapse to 15-20 postganglionic fibres.. 
Upon exiting the sympathetic chain, the fibres enter a less-myelinated gray ramus communicans.Between the 13th and 14th centuries, the first anatomy textbooks in Europe, which included a description of the brain, were written by Mondino de Luzzi and Guido da Vigevano.


== Renaissance ==

Andreas Vesalius noted many structural characteristics of both the brain and general nervous system during his dissections of human cadavers.. In addition to recording many anatomical features such as the putamen and corpus collusum, Vesalius proposed that the brain was made up of seven pairs of 'brain nerves', each with a specialized function.
During the 4th century BC Aristotle thought that, while the heart was the seat of intelligence, the brain was a cooling mechanism for the blood.. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness.In contrast to Greek thought regarding the sanctity of the human body, the Egyptians had been embalming their dead for centuries, and went about the systematic study of the human body.
The first freestanding neuroscience department (then called Psychobiology) was founded in 1964 at the University of California, Irvine by James L.. McGaugh.
During the Hellenistic period, Herophilus of Chalcedon (c.335/330–280/250 BC) and Erasistratus of Ceos (c.. 300–240 BC) made fundamental contributions not only to brain and nervous systems' anatomy and physiology, but to many other fields of the bio-sciences.Yates is Professor of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.The Journal of Neurophysiology publishes original articles on the function of the nervous system.. All levels of function are included, from membrane biophysics to cell biology to systems neuroscience and the experimental analysis of behavior.Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed..

Upon exiting the sympathetic chain, the fibres enter a less-myelinated gray ramus communicans.A number of online neuroscience databases are available which provide information regarding gene expression, neurons, macroscopic brain structure, and neurological or psychiatric disorders.. Some databases contain descriptive and numerical data, some to brain function, others offer access to 'raw' imaging data, such as postmortem brain sections or 3D MRI and fMRI images.Associated cranial nerves are the oculomotor, abducens, trochlear, and hypoglossal nerves.


=== General visceral motor neurons ===
These motor neurons indirectly innervate cardiac muscle and smooth muscles of the viscera ( the muscles of the arteries): they synapse onto neurons located in ganglia of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic), located in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which themselves directly innervate visceral muscles (and also some gland cells).
In consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle.. Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle.
All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates.. By reducing unnecessary muscle fiber recruitment, the body is able to optimize energy consumption.
Persistent Inward Current (PIC) – recent animal study research has shown that constant flow of ions such as calcium and sodium through channels in the soma and dendrites influence the synaptic input.
Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.
A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch.. As a result, if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed, the twitches can superimpose on one another, either through summation or a tetanic contraction.
Parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic, whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline.. (see Table)

This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbors with fluorescence microscopy, enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons.
Optogenetics uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam.. This allows researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way.


=== Non-invasive brain imaging ===
Magnetic resonance imaging has been used extensively to investigate brain structure and function non-invasively in healthy human subjects.
Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below.
Horizontal sections by definition are aligned with the horizon.. In swimming, creeping and quadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts.
For example, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories.. The nervous system also contains nerves, which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body.
For information about the typical structure of the Homo sapiens nervous system, see human brain or peripheral nervous system.. This article discusses information pertinent to the study of neuroanatomy.

Once born, neurons do not divide (see mitosis), and many will live the lifetime of the animal.


== Neurogenesis in mammals ==


=== Developmental neurogenesis ===
During embryonic development, the mammalian central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord) is derived from the neural tube, which contains NSCs that will later generate neurons.
Some evidence indicates postnatal neurogenesis in the human hippocampus decreases sharply in newborns for the first year or two after birth, dropping to "undetectable levels in adults."


== Neurogenesis in other organisms ==
Neurogenesis has been best characterized in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.. In Drosophila, Notch signaling was first described, controlling a cell-to-cell signaling process called lateral inhibition, in which neurons are selectively generated from epithelial cells.If these organisms shared a common evolutionary ancestor, then this might imply that aspects of behavior can be inherited from previous generations, lending support to the genetic causes – as opposed to the environmental causes – of behavior.. Variations in personalities and behavioral traits seen amongst individuals of the same species could be explained by differing levels of expression of these genes and their corresponding proteins.


=== Aggression ===
There is also research being conducted on how an individual's genes can cause varying levels of aggression and aggression control.
LOD is often used in conjunction with pedigrees, maps of a family’s genetic make-up, in order to yield more accurate estimations.. A key benefit of this technique is its ability to give reliable results in both large and small sample sizes, which is a marked advantage in laboratory research.Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping is another statistical method used to determine the chromosomal positions of a set of genes responsible for a given trait.
Research in neurogenetics has yielded some promising results, though, in that mutations at specific gene loci have been linked to harmful phenotypes and their resulting disorders.. For instance a frameshift mutation or a missense mutation at the DCX gene location causes a neuronal migration defect also known as lissencephaly.
The only other point of the life cycle during which expression is this high is during the mid- to late-life period, during 50–70 years of age.. While the increased expression during the prenatal period can be explained by the rapid growth and formation of the brain tissue, the reason behind the surge of late-life expression remains a topic of ongoing research.


== Current research ==
Neurogenetics is a field that is rapidly expanding and growing.
When expressed during early development, BMP's are responsible for the differentiation of epidermal cells from the ventral ectoderm.. Inhibitors of BMPs, such as NOG and CHRD, promote differentiation of ectoderm cells into prospective neural tissue on the dorsal side.Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed..

Astroglial cells in the human have a volume 27 times greater than the same cells in the mouse's brain.These important scientific findings may begin to shift the neuron-specific perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well.
pp.. 560–580.
The glia's importance is becoming ever more clear as time goes on and new research is conducted.. For most of the last century, scientists had written off glial cells as being nothing more than the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place.
"Glial modulation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus".. Glia.
However, detailed studies found no evidence that 'mature' glia, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, retain the ability of mitosis.. Only the resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells seem to keep this ability after the nervous system matures.
47 (3): 249–57.. doi:10.1002/glia.20080.The advantage of measuring the magnetic fields produced by neural activity is that they are likely to be less distorted by surrounding tissue (particularly the skull and scalp) compared to the electric fields measured by electroencephalography (EEG).. Specifically, it can be shown that magnetic fields produced by electrical activity are not affected by the surrounding head tissue, when the head is modeled as a set of concentric spherical shells, each being an isotropic homogeneous conductor.
A disadvantage of EEG and MEG is that both methods have poor spatial resolution when compared to fMRI.


== Criticism and cautions ==
Some scientists have criticized the brain image-based claims made in scientific journals and the popular press, like the discovery of "the part of the brain responsible" for functions like talents, specific memories, or generating emotions such as love.. Many mapping techniques have a relatively low resolution, including hundreds of thousands of neurons in a single voxel.
These properties of SPECT make it particularly well-suited for epilepsy imaging, which is usually made difficult by problems with patient movement and variable seizure types.. SPECT provides a "snapshot" of cerebral blood flow since scans can be acquired after seizure termination (so long as the radioactive tracer was injected at the time of the seizure).

With between 72% and 90% accuracy where chance would achieve 0.8%, fMRI techniques can decide which of a set of known images the subject is viewing.


=== Magnetoencephalography ===
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an imaging technique used to measure the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain via extremely sensitive devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) or spin exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.. MEG offers a very direct measurement of neural electrical activity (compared to fMRI for example) with very high temporal resolution but relatively low spatial resolution.
Many of these studies also have technical problems like small sample size or poor equipment calibration which means they cannot be reproduced - considerations which are sometimes ignored to produce a sensational journal article or news headline.. In some cases the brain mapping techniques are used for commercial purposes, lie detection, or medical diagnosis in ways which have not been scientifically validated.

Conditions that are classed as mental disorders, or learning disabilities and forms of intellectual disability, are not themselves usually dealt with as neurological disorders.. Biological psychiatry seeks to understand mental disorders in terms of their basis in the nervous system, however.
The broadest division is between central nervous system disorders and peripheral nervous system disorders.. The Merck Manual lists brain, spinal cord and nerve disorders in the following overlapping categories:

Brain damage according to cerebral lobe (see also 'lower' brain areas such as basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem):
Frontal lobe damage
Parietal lobe damage
Temporal lobe damage
Occipital lobe damage
Brain dysfunction according to type:
Aphasia (language)
Dysgraphia (writing)
Dysarthria (speech)
Apraxia (patterns or sequences of movements)
Agnosia (identifying things or people)

Lower back and neck pain (see Back pain)
Central neuropathy (see Neuropathic pain)
Neuropsychiatric illnesses (diseases and/or disorders with psychiatric features associated with known nervous system injury, underdevelopment, biochemical, anatomical, or electrical malfunction, and/or disease pathology e.g.Most cases of headache are diagnosed and treated primarily by general practitioners, at least the less severe cases.. Likewise, most cases of sciatica are treated by general practitioners, though they may be referred to neurologists or  surgeons (neurosurgeons or orthopedic surgeons).
The establishment of Joint Commission-certified stroke centers has increased the role of neurologists in stroke care in many primary, as well as tertiary, hospitals.. Some cases of nervous system infectious diseases are treated by infectious disease specialists.
Other neurologists specialize in the use of electrodiagnostic medicine studies – needle EMG and NCSs.. In the US, physicians do not typically specialize in all the aspects of clinical neurophysiology – i.e.
Localization of the pathology is the key process by which neurologists develop their differential diagnosis.. Further tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis and ultimately guide therapy and appropriate management.

A preganglionic fibre may synapse to 15-20 postganglionic fibres.. 
Upon exiting the sympathetic chain, the fibres enter a less-myelinated gray ramus communicans.It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal.. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires.
Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma, and eventually leads to bead like formation.. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation.
When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers.. This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.


=== Axonal degeneration ===
Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury.
The electrical aspect depends on properties of the neuron's membrane.. Like all animal cells,  the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it.
Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid.. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline.

Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment, such as Prozac and Zoloft.


== Connectivity ==

Neurons communicate with one another via synapses, where either the axon terminal or an en passant bouton (a type of terminal located along the length of the axon) of one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite, soma or, less commonly, axon.. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus, have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses.
A neuron, also known as a neurone (British spelling) and nerve cell, is an electrically excitable cell that receives, processes, and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.. These signals between neurons occur via specialized connections called synapses.
However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack the typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors.. When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.
It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses.
Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as excitatory or inhibitory.. Of the four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is ligand gated cation channel.

The "fraction of wire is 0.59 ± 0.036 for layer IV of visual cortex, 0.62 ± 0.055 for layer Ib of piriform cortex, and 0.54 ± 0.035 for the stratum radiatum of hippocampal field CA1.
The overall average is 0.585 ± 0.043; these values are not statistically different from the optimal 3/5."


== Clinical significance ==


=== Schizophrenia ===
It has been shown that a certain protein is lost in patients with schizophrenia that causes dendrites and spines to deteriorate in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a part of the neocortex, which plays a key role in information processing, attention, memory, orderly thinking and planning which are all functions that deteriorate in schizophrenics.. The deterioration of the neuropil in this cortex has been proposed as the cause of schizophrenia.


=== Alzheimer's disease ===
Alzheimer's is a neuropathological disease that is hypothesized to result from the loss of dendritic spines and/or deformation of these spines in the patient's frontal and temporal cortices.
This same phenomenon seems to occur in the elderly as well.


== Other animals ==


=== Other mammals ===
A significant non-human area of neuropil is the barrel cortex found in mammals with whiskers (e.g.. cats, dogs and rodents); each "barrel" in the cortex is a region of neuropil where the input from a single whisker terminates.

Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has led experiments in cooperation with the Dalai Lama on effects of meditation on the brain.. His results suggest that long-term or short-term practice of meditation results in different levels of activity in brain regions associated with such qualities as attention, anxiety, depression, fear, anger, and the ability of the body to heal itself.

Some changes occur seasonally in species to enhance or generate response behaviors.


==== Seasonal brain changes ====
Changing brain behavior and morphology to suit other seasonal behaviors is relatively common in animals.. These changes can improve the chances of mating during breeding season.
The way experience can influence the synaptic organization of the brain is also the basis for a number of theories of brain function including the general theory of mind and Neural Darwinism.. The concept of neuroplasticity is also central to theories of memory and learning that are associated with experience-driven alteration of synaptic structure and function in studies of classical conditioning in invertebrate animal models such as Aplysia.


=== Treatment of brain damage ===
A surprising consequence of neuroplasticity is that the brain activity associated with a given function can be transferred to a different location; this can result from normal experience and also occurs in the process of recovery from brain injury.
In a matter of months, the students' gray matter increased significantly in the posterior and lateral parietal cortex.


== Applications and example ==
The adult brain is not entirely "hard-wired" with fixed neuronal circuits.. There are many instances of cortical and subcortical rewiring of neuronal circuits in response to training as well as in response to injury.
Nudo is also involved in studying the treatment plans that may enhance recovery from strokes, such as physiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and electrical-stimulation therapy.
Jon Kaas, a professor at Vanderbilt University, has been able to show "how somatosensory area 3b and ventroposterior (VP) nucleus of the thalamus are affected by longstanding unilateral dorsal-column lesions at cervical levels in macaque monkeys." Adult brains have the ability to change as a result of injury but the extent of the reorganization depends on the extent of the injury.. His recent research focuses on the somatosensory system, which involves a sense of the body and its movements using many senses.

In the early 1990s V.S.. Ramachandran theorized that phantom limbs were the result of cortical remapping.
This experiment suggests that the subjects had modified the neural representation of their phantom limbs and generated the motor commands needed to execute impossible movements in the absence of feedback from the body.. The authors stated that: "In fact, this finding extends our understanding of the brain's plasticity because it is evidence that profound changes in the mental representation of the body can be induced purely by internal brain mechanisms—the brain truly does change itself."


=== Chronic pain ===

Individuals who suffer from chronic pain experience prolonged pain at sites that may have been previously injured, yet are otherwise currently healthy.
II (1950)].. He stated that a sensory signal in a projection area would be only an inverted and constricted outline that would be magnified due to the increase in recruited cerebral mass, and re-inverted due to some effect of brain plasticity, in more central areas, following a spiral growth.Marian Diamond of the University of California, Berkeley, produced the first scientific evidence of anatomical brain plasticity, publishing her research in 1964.Other significant evidence was produced in the 1960s and after, notably from scientists including Paul Bach-y-Rita, Michael Merzenich along with Jon Kaas, as well as several others.In the 1960s, Paul Bach-y-Rita invented a device that was tested on a small number of people, and involved a person sitting in a chair, in which were embedded nubs that were made to vibrate in ways that translated images received in a camera, allowing a form of vision via sensory substitution.Studies in people recovering from stroke also provided support for neuroplasticity, as regions of the brain remained healthy could sometimes take over, at least in part, functions that had been destroyed;  Shepherd Ivory Franz did work in this area.Eleanor Maguire documented changes in hippocampal structure associated with acquiring the knowledge of London's layout in local taxi drivers.Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed.. Several of these are listed below.T5), and thus enter the white ramus communicans.. This myelinated division can then enter the sympathetic chain.

The specific topics that form the main foci of research change over time, driven by an ever-expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods.
Carl Wernicke further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production.. Modern research through neuroimaging techniques, still uses the Brodmann cerebral cytoarchitectonic map (referring to study of cell structure) anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks.During the 20th century, neuroscience began to be recognized as a distinct academic discipline in its own right, rather than as studies of the nervous system within other disciplines.
For example, individual neuroscientists have promoted neuroscience education among young students by organizing the International Brain Bee, which is an academic competition for high school or secondary school students worldwide.. In the United States, large organizations such as the Society for Neuroscience have promoted neuroscience education by developing a primer called Brain Facts, collaborating with public school teachers to develop Neuroscience Core Concepts for K-12 teachers and students, and cosponsoring a campaign with the Dana Foundation called Brain Awareness Week to increase public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research.
It was believed at the time that the heart was the seat of intelligence.. According to Herodotus, the first step of mummification was to "take a crooked piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils, thus getting rid of a portion, while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs."The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates.
Manuscripts dating to 1700 BC indicate that the Egyptians had some knowledge about symptoms of brain damage.Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a "cranial stuffing" of sorts.. In Egypt, from the late Middle Kingdom onwards, the brain was regularly removed in preparation for mummification.High concentration of an antagonist can completely inhibit the response.. This inhibition can be reversed, however, by an increase of the concentration of the agonist, since the agonist and antagonist compete for binding to the receptor.
AMPT prevents the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine; reserpine prevents dopamine storage within vesicles; and deprenyl inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.


=== Agonists ===

An agonist is a chemical capable of binding to a receptor, such as a neurotransmitter receptor, and initiating the same reaction typically produced by the binding of the endogenous substance.. An agonist of a neurotransmitter will thus initiate the same receptor response as the transmitter.
Immunocytochemical techniques have also revealed that many transmitters, particularly the neuropeptides, are co-localized, that is, one neuron may release more than one transmitter from its synaptic terminal.. Various techniques and experiments such as staining, stimulating, and collecting can be used to identify neurotransmitters throughout the central nervous system.


== Types ==
There are many different ways to classify neurotransmitters.
Many sedative/tranquilizing drugs act by enhancing the effects of GABA.. Correspondingly, glycine is the inhibitory transmitter in the spinal cord.
Acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter discovered in the peripheral and central nervous systems.
Chronic physical or emotional stress can be a contributor to neurotransmitter system changes.. Genetics also plays a role in neurotransmitter activities.
Addictive drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines exert their effects primarily on the dopamine system.. The addictive opiate drugs exert their effects primarily as functional analogs of opioid peptides, which, in turn, regulate dopamine levels.


=== List of neurotransmitters, peptides, and gaseous signaling molecules ===


== Actions ==
Neurons form elaborate networks through which nerve impulses—action potentials—travel.
Thus, despite the wide variety of synapses, they all convey messages of only these two types, and they are labeled as such.. Type I synapses are excitatory in their actions, whereas type II synapses are inhibitory.
Drugs that prevent a neurotransmitter from binding to its receptor are called receptor antagonists.. For example, drugs used to treat patients with schizophrenia such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and clozapine are antagonists at receptors in the brain for dopamine.Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed.. Several of these are listed below.T5), and thus enter the white ramus communicans.. This myelinated division can then enter the sympathetic chain.

=== Computational neuroscience ===
Computational neuroscience includes both the study of the information processing functions of the nervous system, and the use of digital computers to study the nervous system.In teleost fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, the pallial architecture is greatly modified (sharply divergently in fish), with differential growth and specialization of diverse sectors of the conserved pallial Bauplan.. In all vertebrate brains, the telencephalic forebrain consists of two hemispheres, joined at the midline by a region called the septum.
Inside the ring formed thus by the medial and ventral pallium there is a sort of island that contains the dorsal and lateral pallial portions.. In older literature the pallium used to be subdivided only into three zones, called the medial pallium, dorsal (or dorsolateral) pallium, and lateral pallium.
It has been postulated that the neurons forming the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract derive from the dorsal pallium and migrate tangentially into its final position caudal to the olfactory tuberculum.. Situated ventral to the pallium in the basic vertebrate forebrain plan (though representing a topologically rostral field in neural plate fate maps) is another region of telencephalic gray matter known as the subpallium, which is the progenitor area for the basal ganglia, a set of structures that play a crucial role in the executive control of behavior.Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed.. Several of these are listed below.T5), and thus enter the white ramus communicans.. This myelinated division can then enter the sympathetic chain.

Freitas-Magalhaes, A.
A series of logistic regressions were then performed to identify if any of the regions that were identified as consistent and selective to an emotion category were additionally specific to a given category.. Regions were defined as specific to a given emotion if they showed increased activations for only one emotional category, and never showed increased activity during instances of the other emotional categories.
In the amygdala, 66% of studies inducing fear reported activity in this region, as compared to ~20% of studies inducing happiness, ~15% of studies inducing sadness (with no reported activations for anger or disgust).. In the subcallosal cingulate, 46% of studies inducing sadness reported activity in this region, as compared to ~20% inducing happiness and ~20% inducing anger.
The studies included in this meta-analysis used induction methods that elicit emotion experience or emotion perception of fear, sadness, disgust, anger, and happiness.. The goal was to compare locationist approaches with psychological constructionist approaches to emotion.
Consistent neural patterns were defined by brain regions showing increased activity for a specific emotion (relative to a neutral control condition), regardless of the method of induction used (for example, visual vs.. auditory cue).
Studies included in the meta-analysis measured activity in the whole brain and regions of interest (activity in individual regions of particular interest to the study).. 3-D Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS3) statistics were used to compare rough spatial distributions of 3-D activation patterns to determine if statistically significant activations (consistently activated across studies) were specific to particular brain regions for all emotional categories.
In other words, a region could be defined as consistent, selective and specific for e.g.. fear perception if it only showed significantly greater increases in activation during the perception of fear and did not show increased activity during any other emotion categories.
The putative existence of 'basic emotions' and their defining attributes represents a long lasting and yet unsettled issue in psychology.


== Brain areas related to emotion ==
Emotions are thought to be related to activity in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us.. Pioneering work by Paul Broca (1878), James Papez (1937), and Paul D.
However, this specificity may be even more nuanced.. Participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms initially show attentional bias to compulsive threat, but this bias is attenuated in later trials due to habituation to the threat stimuli.


=== Fear potentiated startle ===
Fear-potentiated startle (FPS) has been utilized as a psychophysiological index of fear reaction in both animals and humans.
Consistent and discriminable patterns of neural activation were observed for the five emotional categories.. Happiness was consistently associated with activity in 9 regional brain clusters, the largest located in the right superior temporal gyrus.
Neuroimaging studies using fMRI have demonstrated that the same area of the brain being activated when one is feeling disgust is also activated when one observes another person feeling disgust.. In a traditional learning environment, the teacher's facial expression can play a critical role in students' language acquisition.
Participants are asked to indicate when they see this dot, and response latency is measured.. Dots that appear on the same side of the screen as the image the participant was looking at will be identified more quickly.Oligodendrocytes myelinate the part of the α-MN axon that lies in the central nervous system (CNS), while Schwann cells myelinate the part that lies in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).. The transition between the CNS and PNS occurs at the level of the pia mater, the innermost and most delicate layer of meningeal tissue surrounding components of the CNS.
The axon of an α-MN connects with its extrafusal muscle fiber via a neuromuscular junction, a specialized type of chemical synapse that differs both in structure and function from the chemical synapses that connect neurons to each other.
In addition to receiving neurotrophic factors from muscles, α-MNs also secrete a number of trophic factors to support the muscle fibers they innervate.. Reduced levels of trophic factors contributes to the muscle atrophy that follows an α-MN lesion.


== Connectivity ==
Like other neurons, lower motor neurons have both afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) connections.
For example, the biceps brachii muscle, a muscle of the arm, is innervated by α-MNs in spinal cord segments C5, C6, and C7, which are found rostrally in the spinal cord.. On the other hand, the gastrocnemius muscle, one of the muscles of the leg, is innervated by α-MNs within segments S1 and S2, which are found caudally in the spinal cord.
Alpha motor neurons are located in a specific region of the spinal cord's gray matter.
Without this connection, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) muscle control is impossible.. Voluntary muscle control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from upper motor neurons to muscle fibers.Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed.. Several of these are listed below.T5), and thus enter the white ramus communicans.. This myelinated division can then enter the sympathetic chain.

The advent of in vivo neuroimaging starting in the 1980s led to a further strengthening of interest in the cognitive neurosciences and provided a tool that allowed for lesion, structural, and functional correlations with behavioral dysfunction in living people.

In general, behavioral neuroscientists study similar themes and issues as academic psychologists, though limited by the need to use nonhuman animals.
Upon synaptic vesicle release, the chimeric protein is exposed to the higher pH of the synaptic cleft, causing a measurable change in fluorescence.
Single-unit recording – A method whereby an electrode is introduced into the brain of a living animal to detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip.. Normally this is performed with sedated animals but sometimes it is performed on awake animals engaged in a behavioral event, such as a thirsty rat whisking a particular sandpaper grade previously paired with water in order to measure the corresponding patterns of neuronal firing at the decision point.
Multielectrode recording – The use of a bundle of fine electrodes to record the simultaneous activity of up to hundreds of neurons.
fMRI – Functional magnetic resonance imaging, a technique most frequently applied on human subjects, in which changes in cerebral blood flow can be detected in an MRI apparatus and are taken to indicate relative activity of larger scale brain regions (i.e., on the order of hundreds of thousands of neurons).
PET - Positron Emission Tomography detects particles called photons using a 3-D nuclear medicine examination.
Measuring the magnetic fields created by the electric current flowing within the neurons identifies brain activity associated with various human functions in real time, with millimeter spatial accuracy.. Clinicians can noninvasively obtain data to help them assess neurological disorders and plan surgical treatments.


=== Genetic techniques ===
QTL mapping – The influence of a gene in some behavior can be statistically inferred by studying inbred strains of some species, most commonly mice.
Lesions can be placed with relatively high accuracy "Thanks to a variety of brain 'atlases' which provide a map of brain regions in 3-dimensional "stereotactic coordinates.
Surgical lesions –  Neural tissue is destroyed by removing it surgically.
Electrolytic lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed through the application of electrical shock trauma.
Chemical lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed by the infusion of a neurotoxin.
Temporary lesions – Neural tissue is temporarily disabled by cooling or by the use of anesthetics such as tetrodotoxin.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation – A new technique usually used with human subjects in which a magnetic coil applied to the scalp causes unsystematic electrical activity in nearby cortical neurons which can be experimentally analyzed as a functional lesion.
Synthetic ligand injection – A receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand (RASSL) or Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), permits spatial and temporal control of G protein signaling in vivo.. These systems utilize G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic small molecules ligands, like clozapine N-oxide (CNO), and not to their natural ligand(s).
